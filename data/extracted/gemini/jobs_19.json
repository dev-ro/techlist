As a Windsor Data Analyst/Developer, you are a critical member of a product implementation team that serves our many clients. You enjoy helping our environmental agencies transform data so that they can more efficiently and effectively take the needed actions to improve the environment. During each work day, you thrive as you work independently while contributing as an active team member. About Windsors Solutions, Inc. We are an established, small company headquartered in Portland, OR and we carry a passion for safeguarding and improving our environment. We connection information systems and streamline processes for environmental agencies. Ours is the leading solution in the US. Work life rarely has a dull moment. Your contributions and ideas will be encouraged because we have fostered a team culture where what you say is truly valued. Specific responsibilities will include Developing ETL (extract/transform/load) routines to migrate data from an existing client’s system(s) into Windsor-developed products. Supporting existing clients by troubleshooting and correcting issues in database objects (procedures, functions, triggers). Developing new database objects to support enhanced product functionality. This position requires a high level of proficiency of Microsoft SQL Server’s core platform and T-SQL coding, debugging, and performance tuning. Your communication skills are also critical: you provide effective collaboration with all stakeholders such as Windsor business analysts, the client, and other team members. You gather and define business requirements with clients. As part of your job, you convey technical concepts to non-technical individuals and communicate business requirements and specifications. Once gathered, a major part of your role is to merge these requirements into the project architecture. You are motivated towards building a long-term future with us and, like all team members, we are motivated to invest in you. Your role over time may shift and grow as you develop skills and seek new responsibilities. Skills Required Data Analyst Capabilities Microsoft SQL Server development (stored procedures, SQL queries, performance tuning) Expert knowledge Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes and tools Knowledge of how to retrieve, process, and migrate data from disparate client source systems which are stored in a variety of file formats, DBMSs, and file systems Ability to move and transform that data into the Windsor target proprietary platform Other Minimum 3 years experience as a data analyst Strong verbal and written communications skills Technical Skills Develop code using PowerShell and T-SQL Communicate technical details with the team and client Have an understanding of data models which may include relational, dimensional, entity-relationship, logical and physical and the conversion between logical to physical.

This experience includes basic administrative knowledge such as backup, recovery, moving, partitioning, and both logic and performance enhancements. Communication Skills Experience in requirements gathering with diverse stakeholders, documenting decisions and providing status updates as needed. Be able to translate technical concepts and findings into clear and actionable insights for non-technical audiences. Work closely with product owners and developers to implement product improvements at the database level. Demonstrate resourcefulness in problem-solving and balance independence with escalation when needed. Summary You are good fit at Windsor if you know how to: Target business process functions Relate to the underlying data model(s) Work with the big picture Get into the precise details of a problem Process and operate on existing data If needed, transform and load that data into a client’s existing system Troubleshoot logic and performance with SQL Server stored procedures Communicate to clients with an end result and client satisfaction in mind You need to work independently on your own but also enjoy being a team player.",

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, and innovative tools and approaches are needed to improve the diagnosis and care of individuals with TB infection and disease. This includes children, for whom there is a critical need to improve TB disease and infection detection. The Data Analyst will work with research scientists, clinicians, public health practitioners and collaborators both domestically and internationally to support the collection and analysis of a wide range of data types, including clinical, biological, digital, and real world data, in order to advance TB care locally and globally. Current Major Projects Include Electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to support the latent TB infection (LTBI) care cascade for children in California. We have developed an EHR-based workflow to improve the screening, diagnosis and treatment of LTBI. The Data Analyst will evaluate any changes in outcomes after implementation of these tools by analyzing EHR data across multiple clinics, and will utilize these findings to guide the development of new interventions to improve and/or expand these tools. Skills of interest includes analysis of large datasets, and experience with analysis of EHR or real world data, or a strong interest to work with these data types. The epidemiology and care cascade for Hepatitis B-TB co-infection. In partnership with collaborators from local public health departments and other regional health systems, we are examining the LTBI care cascade for individuals who are living with Hepatitis B and TB infection. Utilizing EHR, surveillance, and claims data, the Data Analyst will conduct the evaluation of the Hepatitis B-TB care cascade to guide interventions to improve the care of this vulnerable population. Skills of interest are similar to the child LTBI care cascade analyses. Rapid Research in Diagnostics Development for TB Network (R2D2 TB Network) – This National Institutes of Health (NIH) U01-funded project established a multi-country platform for identifying promising early stage diagnostics from a broad range of product developers and conducting field evaluations in TB endemic countries to advance their development and evaluate their accuracy. This includes the evaluation of novel diagnostics in children (R2D2 Kids) and the role of digital diagnostics (i.e., cough sounds, lung sounds, chest x-ray images). The Data Analyst will work with other data analysts, data scientists and clinical research coordinators to support data collection, data management and accuracy analyses. Skills of interest include experience with REDCap, data management, and statistical computing (i.e., R, Stata, or Python). Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings – This NIH R01-funded study seeks to identify novel biomarkers that can diagnose TB in children, utilizing retrospective and prospective cohorts in Uganda, South Africa, the Gambia, Peru and India. We will develop and validate combined host- and pathogen-based biosignatures using large ‘Omics-based datasets including proteomics and metabolomics, combined with clinical data. As needed, the Data Analyst will work with other data analysts, data scientists, and lab-based researchers to maintain the biorepository database and support analyses. Progression of Tuberculosis infection in young children with and without HIV (PROTECT). This is an NIH-funded study that seeks to identify biomarkers that will predict if a child with evidence of TB exposure or infection will progression to symptomatic TB disease. Cross-sectional and serial biological samples from children from Uganda, South Africa, the Gambia, and Vietnam will be analyzed using high-throughput ‘Omics approaches including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. As needed, the Data Analyst will work with other data analysts, data scientists, and lab-based researchers to maintain the biorepository database and support analyses.
