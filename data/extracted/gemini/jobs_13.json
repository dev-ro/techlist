The Senior GRC Security Analyst is expected to support the security strategy of the business within new and existing information system capabilities. The position requires both an understanding of legacy systems, as well as new technologies and requirements.

The role oversees the business’ security requirements and obligations mandated by standards and regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). In tandem with security leadership, the GRC security analyst consistently assesses and validates the assurance of the security program.

Maintain strong oversight of third parties, vendors, and business partners to safeguard against undue risk presented by external entities. Escalate to security management and business unit leads when points of weakness are discovered. Analyze findings, document, recommend, and report program gaps to security leadership. Monitor current and proposed security changes impacting regulatory, privacy, and security industry best practice guidance. Support audit practices and processes and work with the IT organization to ensure findings are remediated. Document and capture qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess the success of the security program and provide regular reports to security and business leadership. Ensure security and technology teams maintain up-to-date configuration documentation for systems and processes. Liaison with auditors, both internal and external, to maintain and implement controls for compliance and privacy laws. Foster strong relationships with internal business units and excel in risk management, technical controls, and cybersecurity communication. Travel as needed to office locations and third-party on-site engagements. Perform other duties as assigned. Here’s what you’ll need: Bachelor's degree in information assurance, MIS, cybersecurity, business, or equivalent experience. Master's degree preferred.

Who You'll Work With As a Business Solutions Engineer, you will work closely with stakeholders across the organization to drive innovation and deliver value through technology. Who You Are Superb communication and interpersonal skills, with an ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences. Demonstrated leadership abilities and experience in managing cross-functional teams. Deep knowledge of Cisco products and solutions is highly desirable.

Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions. What you’ll do As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention. Responsibilities Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business. Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums. Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience. Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights. Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business. Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage. Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements 8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field Proficiency in SQL and Python Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams Strong knowledge of statistics Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail Outstanding written and verbal communication skills Preferred Qualifications Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark) Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

        "created_on": 1720624705.5140786,
        "description": "Thank you for stopping by to take a look at the Data Engineer with a focus on SSRS and PowerBI role I have posted here on LinkedIN, I appreciate it. If you have read my JD's in the past, you will know that I like to add humor to these things. So, if you see something in here that gives you a chuckle, that was the intent. If you are new to my JD's, welcome to the party. As with just about everything I work on, social fit is going to be almost as important as the technical fit. So, you might ask...what are some of these social fit pieces of this role: This is a role where you will be working with end users and that need to communicate in the same mindset of that great Steven Covey habit of 'first seek to understand...then to be understood' will be needed for success here. By the way, if you haven't read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, oh man...you are really missing out. It just might change how you communicate with everyone about everything. Have you ever been in an environment with a lot of backstabbing passive aggressive types? That kinda stinks, doesn't it? Well, you wont have to deal with that here. The individuals you will be working with actually have a vested interest in your success and will cheer you on as opposed to drag you down. You will be working on things that actually have consequences to the overall business. This is a 100 year old law firm that is really using IT to drive decisions (I know, who would have thunk that). So, that ability to collaborate with others, drive into the details of what is really being asked, and then execute on that will be a real key to success here. This role is permanent and fully benefited This role is being done in a hybrid manner with 3 days onsite (311 West Monroe in Downtown Chicago) and 2 days remote. We are only able to work with candidates that already reside in the Chicago area for this role. I can only work with US Citizens or Green Card Holders for this role. Here is what we are looking for: The official Title of this role is 'Financial Applications Data Engineer'. However, under the covers, it is really a Data role focused on SSRS and PowerBI. If you have some really solid SSRS and PowerBI skills along with some SSIS skills, that is spot on with what we are seeking in this role. You will be responsible for the data analysis, dashboarding, and reporting for the finance & accounting departments. The ETL skill (SSIS) will be needed so that your reporting and PBI dashboards will actually reflect the right data as opposed to reporting off of stuff that doesn't make a ton of sense. You will be working within an existing team of data engineers that focus on the data layer as well as other aspects of the BI stack. I won't bore you to tears with a ton of essential duties...instead, I will share the highlights: Rapidly builds and maintains an understanding of the firm’s “data landscape” – the key systems and databases used across the firm, how they are used, their data, data models and data integrations, with a specific focus on Finance & Accounting data. Work with fun stuff like data cleansing efforts, creation of reliable data pipelines and ETL processes, join & relate data from disparate systems. Prepare data for modeling, reporting, visualization and analysis (you will be working with the backend data team for the preparation part...we really want to to want to participate, however). Generate a variety of reporting outputs, leveraging Microsoft Power BI and other tools. Works with our Enterprise Data Architect in the design and implementation of new data models that may pertain to Finance & Accounting. Design and build sSQL queries, views, functions and stored procedures. Develop and implements various Finance & Accounting and related dashboards. Provide technical assistance and guidance to others, both within and outside of IT, helping them to locate and access the data they need. Works with our Enterprise Data Architect and Data Engineers in other functions to build a strong community of expertise that supports the development and delivery of the firm’s data strategy Design, builds and tests data structures and reporting process/systems Participates in rotational 24 x 7 application support ensuring that the application portfolio uptime is maintained according to defined SLA’s Here is what we are seeking: At least 4 years of PowerBI and SSRS experience. I am more interested in breath and depth of that PBI & SSRS experience. So, we are looking for that ability to 'make sense of data'...not just build reports and dashboards. Experience working with organizational data warehouses, including the creation and management of the data residing within them. You will be focusing on the presentation layer (SSRS and PBI), but that experience with understanding what the data and ETL layer is telling you will be need in this role. So, yep, we are looking for at least some SSIS experience. Experience with both on prem Sql and Azure Sql. Data engineering certifications (e.g. Azure Certified Data Engineer) are a plus.",
