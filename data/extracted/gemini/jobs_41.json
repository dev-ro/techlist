These one- to three-year fellowships are competitive and are designed to advance NASA‚Äôs missions in space science, Earth science, aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, and astrobiology. Description: Heliophysics has a vast wealth of data, sampling a wide range of domains, such as the solar interior, corona, heliosphere, magnetosphere, ionosphere, upper atmosphere. There are diverse data sets and models representing many properties (e.g. intensity, magnetic field, current, density, velocity, temperature). These data sets are used to study physical processes and relationships (such as turbulence, waves, shocks, magnetic reconnection) which vary over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Because of this, there are many associated challenges facing data science in heliophysics. Modern methods in data science have the potential to access new, exciting results that eluded classical analysis approaches. Machine learning has been shown to improve performance in several elements of space weather forecasting. However, a deep comprehension of machine learning techniques in the context of the heliophysics data environment will open new opportunities for cross-disciplinary sharing and cooperation. More deliberate approaches can help reveal the fundamental physical processes that govern heliophysical systems, and adaptation of methods to specifically target the underlying physics can help turn an improved correlation or forecast into deeper physical insight and understanding. This opportunity emphasizes the use of machine learning, AI, and advanced mathematical methods to expand the discovery potential of heliophysics mission data, theoretical models, and simulations. Examples include deep learning, neural networks, data segmentation, high dimensionality, and advanced statistical/probabilistic methods.

Description The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a full time Scientific Web Application Developer position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Washington, D.C. The Office of Research and Development at the EPA is a leader in the science of human health and ecological risk assessment, a process used to determine how pollutants or other stressors may impact human health and the environment. What The EPA Project Is About ORD addresses the needs of stakeholders by preparing technical reports and assessments that integrate and evaluate the most up-to-date research. These products serve as a major component of the scientific foundation supporting EPA's regulations and policies. ORD also conducts cutting-edge research to develop innovative quantitative risk assessment methods and tools that help extrapolate between experimental data and real-world scenarios, improve our understanding of uncertainties, and facilitate careful weighing of evidence using approaches such as systematic review. ORD produces and maintains a series of documents and information that are used to inform regulatory programs. These documents are collectively known as assessment products: Integrated Science Assessments (ISAs), Provisional Peer-Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTVs), and Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). Both commercial and EPA-managed software are used in the production and maintenance of assessment products. EPA-managed software includes the Health and Environmental Research Online (HERO) database and the Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC). HERO includes more than 2 million scientific references and data from the peer-reviewed literature, and HAWC is an open-source web-application used by scientists at EPA for extracting and visualizing data extracted from scientific literature to summarize evidence and key findings. ORD also routinely investigates opportunities to automate processes in the production and maintenance of assessment products including automation of technical editing or rapid prototyping of potential features for HERO and/or HAWC. Assessment products supported by HERO, HAWC, and the wider collection of software, tools, and databases characterize the nature and magnitude of health risks to humans and the ecosystem from pollutants and chemicals in the environment. ORD tools also support development of technical products in other EPA Program Offices and Regions (e.g., OCSPP). What experience and skills will you gain? As a team member, you will provide software development, data analysis, and data visualization support to the EPA-managed software, tools, and databases supporting assessment products including HERO and HAWC projects.
