We have an extremely good relationship with this client and work directly with the CTO, who has started several companies and had multiple successful exits, including an IPO. We have placed quite a few engineers at this firm over the last year, and everyone we have placed is extremely happy. (Even those who did not get an offer were left with very positive impressions.) Target salary range is 120k to 200k+ + equity, depending on experience level and location. (Note: At $170k base salary or above, generally candidates need 5+ years of experience and a very strong interview.) The company is profitable and growing fast with approximately 100+ employees. Positions are available in Tysons Corner, VA, and Salt Lake City, UT. The work environment is hybrid, typically 3 days/week in the office so people know each other, but those hours are flexible to accommodate family/childcare and traffic. The Benefits Are Great And Include Company Equity Options and 401(k) Plan Unlimited PTO and Wellness Reimbursement U.S. Holidays Paid Parental Leave Comprehensive Insurance (Medical, Dental, and Vision) This company is completely private sector, no security clearance required.

        "description": "What if you had a chance to prevent cybercrime and be at the forefront of innovation by bringing AI to the most important industries? That’s what we’re doing over at Layerup — we’re building a cybersecurity suite for LLMs to remove bottlenecks to AI adoption in every single industry on the planet. We’re a seed-stage startup backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley like Founders Inc, Y Combinator, Multicoin Capital, CapitalX, Founders of Polygon (Sandeep and Jaynti), OrangeDAO, and a few more amazing angels like Shaan Puri. If you’re applying to this position, you love startups and inventing products! You like to move fast, challenge people on their assumptions, have an intrinsic motivation to make things that create a BIG impact, and most importantly you truly resonate with the mission. Why Join? Tackle impactful problems: We’re a team that thinks in terms of impact. As you’re thinking about which company to join, I would recommend looking into the importance and scale of Cybersecurity in our world today. There is a cybercrime every 39 seconds(!). With LLMs, this is bound to increase. Instead of wasting time building another AI search engine of an AI chatbot, we’re solving cybercrime. Be at the forefront of innovation: Today, we’re completely focused on securely bringing LLMs in every single industry, but in the next decade, we won’t shy away from disrupting ourselves. Again, our mission is to boost innovation in areas that lack it. You will learn cutting-edge skills that will define the future. Accelerate your learnings: Joining an early-stage AI startup is the best possible way to learn fast and build something that will be used by billions of people in the coming years. We’ve personally hacked on multiple products that we shipped in less than 24 hours. Startups are the best possible career choice from the standpoint of learning fast and rapidly gaining important skills. That’s exactly our moat — learning about what (are the right) specs to ship faster than any other company. Skills Strong Full-stack software fundamentals (React, Node js, MongoDB, and more) Knowledge of and passion for AI: strong fundamentals of fine-tuning, prompt engineering, building extensive RAG pipelines, and more. We like to work with people who already have shipped AI applications end to end. Hunger to learn: You can quickly learn how to work with services and tools even without previous experience. This is particularly true today and will remain true as we grow. We have to invent faster than Moore's law. Excellent written communication (design docs, specs, documentation, code reviews, post-mortems) Impatient with execution, but patient with results (aka you’re the type of person who makes shit happen) Bonus points: startup experience, built AI apps, worked with more than just GPT-4, or personal interest in AI. Benefits And Impact Create a leading piece of software that will remove the bottleneck to AI adoption in every single industry: We’re on an extremely impactful mission. The world doesn’t need the 10th CRM or the 20th social consumer app. The world needs startups solving really hard real-life problems. Work with the best: We want to build a product-obsessed engineering-heavy culture. Our major focus in the early days would be writing code and talking to users. Help us build this product-obsessed culture from day 1. Join a strong engineering, entrepreneurial, and builder culture: We want our founding team to be entrepreneurial and build a company from 0 to 1. We're all builders. All of us like to stay at the cutting edge of tech and this company is an artistic reflection of ourselves. Join as one of the early team members of a category-defining company. Our primary goal is to develop this company into a category-defining entity. We are at the beginning stages, and being an early member allows you to have a front-row seat in shaping history.

        "description": "Observe is a SaaS Observability product that enables businesses to investigate modern distributed applications 10x faster. Observe ingests anything with a timestamp (e.g. system and application logs, metrics, and traces), and then structures that data so that it is correlated and easy to navigate. We enable engineers to spend more time coding features and less time investigating incidents. Finally, because of Observe’s unique elastic architecture, it is priced based on usage, making it cost 10x less than incumbents. Traditional approaches to this problem have resulted in fragmented tooling and fragile dashboards which, in turn, have resulted in exploding costs and complexity. At Observe, we believe that the core challenge lies in organizing and relating telemetry data emitted by those applications, despite the fact it is constantly changing. Solving this data problem makes observability an order of magnitude easier, faster, and less expensive. At Observe, we didn’t set out to build another monitoring tool company, we set out to build a data company.

        "description": "About Fractional AI Fractional AI is the dev shop for applied AI. We solve hard AI-driven problems that our customers don't have the resources or know-how to staff themselves – cutting through jargon and flashy demos to get AI into production, fast. We believe that the most revolutionary impact of generative AI will be helping to automate existing workflows for large enterprises. Automating the most complex workflows - think call centers dealing with confidential health information - requires custom solutions and exceptional talent. Our model ensures the best talent is working on the most challenging automation opportunities. By joining Fractional AI, you’re stepping onto an in-person, San Francisco based team with the culture of a startup but the thorny, far-reaching engineering puzzles impacting millions of users. We are a curious bunch of doers looking for AI engineers who are smart, nice, and get things done. About The Role You’ll play a leading role in building and shipping AI applications for our inaugural customers - from understanding customer needs to deploying solutions in their environments - all while shaping our Engineering and broader Fractional culture for the next 100+ engineers. What you bring to the table: You write exceptional code + deeply care about the craft of coding (4+ years of experience): you build elegant, production-ready code; you have strong proficiency across multiple programming languages You have a track record building with Large Language Models: you have experience building scalable applications with LLMs, using frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc You love solving hard, new problems: you are comfortable self-teaching, asking “why?,” and experimenting to solve problems you haven’t seen before You are ‘start-up ready’: you jump in without instruction, embrace a ‘no job too big, no job too small’ mindset, and want to shape strategy and culture You are comfortable talking with users: you deeply care about the user and skillfully navigate user conversations to ensure what we’re building meets their needs You are a great teammate: you are comfortable helping others (and asking for help), you champion integrity in everything, and want to build a one-in-a-career culture of personal growth You will: Design and develop custom AI solutions tailored to the unique needs of our customers, ensuring seamless integration and scalability Partner with a high-caliber team across the full project lifestyle, from requirements gathering, to prototyping, system design, coding, testing, deployment, and support Actively shape our Engineering and broader company culture - from how we learn, to how we hire, to how we celebrate - you’ll shape how we make Fractional a place we all love working Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us We’re big believers in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you. Why join Fractional? Apply, don’t just talk about AI: You’ll have a front row seat to how the world’s leading companies are actually deploying AI solutions – positioning you in the top percentile of AI engineers with the experience building AI applications across this breadth of customers and use cases. Projects range from bespoke RAG applications, to optimizing developer productivity, automating integrations, building AI phone agents, and more. Solve big, real problems: companies come to us when they can’t solve some of their biggest problems themselves. For you, that means learning everyday, never getting bored or stuck on maintenance, and working across a range of industries, customers, and products. Learn with and from the best in person: the team is built from multi-time founders and co-founded by Travis May, former CEO of LiveRamp and founder + former CEO of Datavant. Working elbow to elbow in our San Francisco office means things like team lunches, quick brainstorming + pair coding, and the right amount of banter. Why shouldn't you join Fractional? Preference for speed over quality: we love hacking things together for a proof of concept (and run regular team hackathons!) but ultimately our code will be put into production in our customers’ environments - you need to enjoy shipping code that’s clean, understandable, and scalable. Predictability is important to you: you’ll be working across customers, programming languages, industries and projects, which means you won’t be becoming an expert in the same product suite or serving the same user day after day. User conversations aren’t your thing: We all have our own preferences - at Fractional, you’ll spend most of your time coding, but you’ll also be closer to the user than other engineering roles. You’ll be directly interfacing with our customer contacts (usually engineers on the customer’s internal team) to ask questions and problem solve. Our Values Overdeliver. Overuse AI. Over \"engineer\" the culture. Location San Francisco, CA (4 days in-person, Fridays remote) Benefits 🏦 Competitive Compensation Package: Attractive salary aligned with your experience and skills. 📈 401k with Matching: Invest in your future with our company-matched retirement plan. 🌴 Unlimited PTO: Take the time you need to relax and rejuvenate. 🏥 Exceptional Medical, Dental, and Vision Coverage: Comprehensive health benefits to keep you and your family healthy. 🚑 Health FSA: Manage out-of-pocket health expenses effectively. 🚌 Commuter Benefits: Make your travel to work easier and more affordable. 🏥 Life Insurance: Providing peace of mind for you and your loved ones. 🎉 Team Events and Activities: Regular events to build camaraderie and a strong team spirit.

        "description": "Who we are The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos. About Pano: Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia. Recent media coverage includes being named one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023 by FastCompany and recipient of the Innovative Mobile Service and Application Award at Mobile World Congress through our partnership with T-Mobile. Pano brings together a diverse team bridging frontline, wildland firefighting experience with best-in-class know-how in operations, logistics, artificial intelligence, and software. Our team is composed of experienced technology professionals from companies such as Apple, Cisco, Nest, DoorDash and Meta. Headquartered in San Francisco with an office and factory in the Mission District, our hybrid team works from locations around the world. Founded in mid-2020, we’ve raised over $40M from leading VC funds. The Role The Computer Vision Engineer will be a part of the detection team that develops and deploys AI to detect wildfires in mountaintop camera and satellite images.

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams. A portfolio company is looking to hire senior machine learning engineers as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit. While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup: Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination. Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working. Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions. Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).",

        "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About The Role We are looking for software engineers to help build safety and oversight mechanisms for our AI systems. As a trust and safety software engineer, you will work to monitor models, prevent misuse, and ensure user well-being. This role will focus on building systems to detect unwanted model behaviors and prevent disallowed use of models. You will apply your technical skills to uphold our principles of safety, transparency, and oversight while enforcing our terms of service and acceptable use policies. Responsibilities Develop monitoring systems to detect unwanted behaviors from our API partners and potentially take automated enforcement actions; surface these in internal dashboards to analysts for manual review Build abuse detection mechanisms and infrastructure Surface abuse patterns to our research teams to harden models at the training stage Build robust and reliable multi-layered defenses for real-time improvement of safety mechanisms that work at scale Analyze user reports of inappropriate content or accounts You may be a good fit if you: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience 3-8+ years of experience in a software engineering position, preferably with a focus on integrity, spam, fraud, or abuse detection. Proficiency in SQL, Python, and data analysis tools. Strong communication skills and ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders Strong candidates may also: Have experience building trust and safety mechanisms for AI/ML systems, such as fraud detection models or security monitoring tools or the infrastructure to support these systems at scale Have experience with machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, or Pytorch, and experience building machine learning models Have experience with prompt engineering, jailbreak attacks, and other adversarial inputs Have worked closely with operational teams to build custom internal tooling Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Annual Salary The expected salary range for this position is: $320,000 — $405,000 USD Logistics Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. Compensation and Benefits* Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates. Equity - For eligible roles , equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance. US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents. 401(k) plan with 4% matching. 22 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness. Fertility benefits via Carrot. Daily lunches and snacks in our office. Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area. UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents. Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary). 21 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Health cash plan. Life insurance and income protection. Daily lunches and snacks in our office. This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

        "description": "📯 We’re hiring a founding engineer at Goblins — join us in inspiring 1B kids to love to learn. 📯 The Problem We Solve In a 30-student math class, half of kids are ready to accelerate, while half are still working on their foundational skills. This is a huge pain for teachers: they simply cannot keep track of each student’s abilities, prepare alternate curriculum, and give them live instruction and feedback. Until now. With Goblins, we’ve created a new kind of math pedagogy that feels like magic to kids. Think of Goblins like a \"smart worksheet\": it lets students draw math on any device and get instant feedback, and helps teachers figure out where students need the most help, and fix it. ([Preview here](https://youtu.be/SH9UomzBMUs)!) Our Traction Goblins launched to a private beta in March with 15 schools and 300 students. 100% of our latest cohort are repeat users, and we are post-revenue in two markets. We’ve also raised from angels so that we can scale up to the 1000’s of teachers on our waitlist. The Team Co-founder Sawyer is the former Head of Design at X1 (acq. by Robinhood) and a former math teacher, and Alp is an AI engineer from Amazon and Stripe. The Role At Goblins, you’ll take on big, open-ended engineering problems to ensure students and teachers both have a mind-blowing experience next year. Some of these are… ✅ Building a knowledge graph representing mastery of a math subject, and updating it based on student performance ✅ Building a version of the app that watches student work on real paper from a camera ✅ Expanding our “tangent” feature, which acts more of a primary instructor, and uses the LLM to compose visual modules on-demand for the student when they're struggling If you’re looking to profoundly change the course others’ lives, play a pivotal role early in a company’s life, and get your hands dirty with LLMs, then we should definitely chat.",

The founding team has experience running data teams and building products at companies like Stripe, Pinterest, Twitter, Cruise, Reddit and Coinbase. We’ve raised $3M from world-class investors. 🔮 Our vision The jobs of the last million data professionals will look different than the next million. Data is more vital to an organization than ever before but the majority of data tools are still too complex and hard to use. We combine modern data warehousing technology, AI and a delightful user experience to craft what we believe will be a category-defining product. If we are successful in our mission, we will change how organizations use data to develop products, run daily operations and plan for the future. 👩‍💻 About the role We are looking for a stellar full-stack engineer to join our engineering team. You’ll work directly with the co-founders and our early customers to help data teams around the world be more effective at working with their data. This is a role that is strongly focused on product and you will often be designing new features from scratch that are brand new to the industry. Customer-facing product development experience is a big plus. We offer competitive salary and equity as well as a slate of other benefits: Health insurance Dental insurance Vision insurance New equipment (new Macbooks, monitor, etc) Quarterly offsites 🏗️ Interesting Problems We are Solving There is no shortage of interesting technical problems to solve in our space. We have years of work ahead of us and your time spent working with us will be on high-impact, customer-facing products. Here’s a preview of some of the types of projects you can expect to work on: Developing AI models that can generate SQL, write documentation and understand an organization’s data models in their warehouse Hacking up SQL compilers, network libraries and abstract syntax tree parsers to generate a column-level data lineage view of an entire data warehouse Building large canvas, Figma-like frontend experiences Architecting large scale workflow systems Designing realtime, multiplayer infrastructure 🛠️ Our Engineering Culture At Turntable, we take inspiration from how some of the best engineering teams in the industry operate. We don’t shy away from adding in our own remixes as well. Some Examples Of How We Work We dogfood our own product every day. We build data pipelines for our business in Turntable and we often hop into our product to help customers be successful. We prioritize speed and rapid iteration. We believe that done is better than perfect and that most of the learning of a feature happens after launch. We are low ego and high empathy. We believe good software is not enough to build a category-defining product - we also need a highly functional team. We all wear the customer hat.

It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system. Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds. Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.2B from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes. We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses. About The Role We use machine learning and large language models to build software which helps our customers operate their business effectively.

The key responsibility in this role will be to apply AI/ML techniques to identify software bugs and/or reduce the search space for where to look for them. Please note this also includes significant components of software engineering and is not just building models. The founding team at this client is exceptional: they have started and sold two prior companies, the last one to a top tech giant, and they have built systems that others said could not be built. They have assembled a team (~40-50) of incredibly talented, very high-end scientists and engineers that like to solve \"impossible\" problems. Morale at this company is very high, and so are the hiring standards. This company is looking for top engineers who can work with a team and enjoy what they do. Target salary range is 120k to 250k+ plus equity, depending on experience level. (Note: At $170k base salary or above, generally candidates need at least 5+ years of experience and a very strong interview.) All positions are full-time, in-office near Tysons Corner, VA, in the Virginia tech corridor. There is a small future possibility of work in the UK. This company is completely private sector, no security clearance required. However, employment is open to U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card) only at this time. We are unable to sponsor visas. If you apply but this company is not a fit, we will consider you for other available positions as well. Not your dream job, but perfect for a friend? You can submit a referral and get a check for $2000 or more: https://www.taskforcetalent.com/referral/ (Terms and conditions apply.) _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Qualifications U.S. Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident Strong background in computer science; this company is open to physicists/mathematicians but in our experience candidates typically need to have theoretical computer science foundations or significant coding experience to pass the technical interviews Candidates must be comfortable with and have a track record of solving hard problems. For this specific role, candidates should have a good understanding of AI/ML techniques and experience using it to deliver results. (Again, not just plug and chug or building models and throwing them over the wall.) Strong programming experience and credentials. Any serious language is ok. This company assumes any candidate they hire is smart enough to figure out the syntax of a new language and use the right tool for the job. Solid understanding of algorithms and data structures as well as cloud experience (any of the major providers, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.) At least 3, ideally 5+ years experience ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interview Process The process typically involves an initial phone screen, a technical coding interview (can be virtual), and several on-site interviews. Often part of the on-site interview is a technical presentation on a problem the candidate has solved or something the candidate has built, and the discussions will go from there. This company has genius-level engineers who like to get into the details! _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ About Us Task Force Talent is a specialized recruiting firm for science, engineering, and security careers.
