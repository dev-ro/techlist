Combining unmatched experience and specialized skills across more than 40 industries, we offer Strategy and , Interactive, Technology, and Operations services, all powered by the world’s largest network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers. Our 738,000 people deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity every day, serving clients in more than 120 countries. We embrace the power of change to create value and shared success for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Visit us at www.accenture.com. You Are: Most Product Managers, engineers, and designers get to build software systems. Very few get to say with a straight face: “I’m reinventing banking.” Or hospitality, or logistics, or insurance. We’re combining Product, technology, industry expertise, and entrepreneurial experience to massively disrupt our clients’ core businesses. We partner with our clients to propel them into the future and to help create better products and experiences for everyone. We’re doing this by working with leaders in the industry, across Accenture teams, and technology partnerships to help clients re-invent themselves and re-imagine their services as products. Our Product Model Realization team is made up of experienced professionals who bridge the divide between product and technology. We create space for our clients to collaborate, transform and grow while maintaining a focus on delivering business value through technology driven products. Our cross functional team is deeply hands-on, and we pride ourselves in being battle hardened with the ability to think at a strategic level to drive vision and be the first to help our clients embark on the difficult transformation journey with confidence. We lead-from-the-front utilizing our technology thought leaders in conjunction with industry experience to help our clients define a product vision and bring it to life. In this role as a Domain Architect, you will be at the nexus point between business vision, user experience, and technology delivery. Within this role you will follow Accenture playbooks for facilitating activities like strategic event storming, context mapping, and the definition of a product north star. Many times, this journey will come with few mile markers, depending on your experience and creativity to guide our clients to an achievable product portfolio. You will have the opportunity to peer with other Accenture team members in creating and leading teams to solve some of the hardest problems in product vision, definition, and implementation to transform & disrupt established industries Preferred Background in 1 of the following industries: Financial Services: We are in the midst of helping clients fundamentally rethink payments, commercial banking, retirement and other core systems which are 25+ years old. The industry is at a crossroads, and needs help from the outside in order to make most efficient use of capital, retain customers in the face of emerging competition, and compete as the market rapidly changes. This also means discarding existing constraints and preconceptions to develop a modern product-drive portfolio of services which comprehensively meet the businesses needs. We are looking for industry veterans who are tired of the status quo of being asked to retrofit their competitors products onto burning platforms and look-alike services. If you have a vision for next generation financial service offerings, we have a place for you. Specific Experience Minimum 3+ years working as a product owner in an industry leading banking, payments, or capital markets firm OR has been part of defining a product vision for a demonstrably successful fintech product company. Successful discovery and north star definition of financial industry products by domain, translated into successful agile system implementation and operation. OR Aerospace/Defense: Suppliers, manufacturers, and operators in a once-closed ecosystem area being challenged. This brings new partner possibilities & a market force for change to existing organizations. As the Aerospace & Defense industry looks to incorporate new technologies & processes into its physical space, there is more pressure to move from initiative-based mindset to the creation, operation, and decommissioning of product services. All while maintaining the same strict control and quality assurance required of this space. If you’re an industry veteran who wants to help bridge the gap from R&D/POA into product manufacturing without blinders of single project constraints, we have a place for you.

OR Supply Chain/Logistics: In a world where Just-In-Time logistics is at odds with volatile global economics & disasters, our clients are desperate to build upon their existing expertise with a stronger ability to adapt real-time to changing situations. When the cost of redirecting cargo can fluctuate in minutes, management of supply chain and logistics must merge its short and long-term horizon. This means designing & offering a large portfolio of products & solutions which can often have their availability, cost, and margin change minute by minute. It also means the introduction of new products is a constant, while making sure that undesirable overlap is minimized. If you’re an industry veteran who wants to stop hiding new offerings in old wrappers with manual data fixes & overhead, we have a place for you.

We embrace the power of change to create value and shared success for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Visit us at www.accenture.com. You Are: Most Product Managers, engineers, and designers get to build software systems. Very few get to say with a straight face: “I’m reinventing banking.” Or hospitality, or logistics, or insurance. We’re combining Product, technology, industry expertise, and entrepreneurial experience to massively disrupt our clients’ core businesses. We partner with our clients to propel them into the future and to help create better products and experiences for everyone. We’re doing this by working with leaders in the industry, across Accenture teams, and technology partnerships to help clients re-invent themselves and re-imagine their services as products. Our Product Model Realization team is made up of experienced professionals who bridge the divide between product and technology. We create space for our clients to collaborate, transform and grow while maintaining a focus on delivering business value through technology driven products. Our cross functional team is deeply hands-on, and we pride ourselves in being battle hardened with the ability to think at a strategic level to drive vision and be the first to help our clients embark on the difficult transformation journey with confidence. We lead-from-the-front utilizing our technology thought leaders in conjunction with industry experience to help our clients define a product vision and bring it to life. In this role as a Domain Architect, you will be at the nexus point between business vision, user experience, and technology delivery. Within this role you will follow Accenture playbooks for facilitating activities like strategic event storming, context mapping, and the definition of a product north star. Many times this journey will come with few mile markers, depending on your experience and creativity to guide our clients to an achievable product portfolio. You will have the opportunity to peer with other Accenture team members in creating and leading teams to solve some of the hardest problems in product vision, definition, and implementation to transform & disrupt established industries Preferred Background in 1 of the following industries: Financial Services: We are in the midst of helping clients fundamentally rethink payments, commercial banking, retirement and other core systems which are 25+ years old. The industry is at a crossroads, and needs help from the outside in order to make most efficient use of capital, retain customers in the face of emerging competition, and compete as the market rapidly changes. This also means discarding existing constraints and preconceptions to develop a modern product-drive portfolio of services which comprehensively meet the businesses needs. We are looking for industry veterans who are tired of the status quo of being asked to retrofit their competitors products onto burning platforms and look-alike services. If you have a vision for next generation financial service offerings, we have a place for you. Specific Experience Minimum 3+ years working as a product owner in an industry leading banking, payments, or capital markets firm OR has been part of defining a product vision for a demonstrably successful fintech product company.

OR Aerospace/Defense: Suppliers, manufacturers, and operators in a once-closed ecosystem area being challenged. This brings new partner possibilities & a market force for change to existing organizations. As the Aerospace & Defense industry looks to incorporate new technologies & processes into its physical space, there is more pressure to move from initiative-based mindset to the creation, operation, and decommissioning of product services. All while maintaining the same strict control and quality assurance required of this space. If you’re an industry veteran who wants to help bridge the gap from R&D/POA into product manufacturing without blinders of single project constraints, we have a place for you.

OR Supply Chain/Logistics: In a world where Just-In-Time logistics is at odds with volatile global economics & disasters, our clients are desperate to build upon their existing expertise with a stronger ability to adapt real-time to changing situations. When the cost of redirecting cargo can fluctuate in minutes, management of supply chain and logistics must merge its short and long-term horizon. This means designing & offering a large portfolio of products & solutions which can often have their availability, cost, and margin change minute by minute. It also means the introduction of new products is a constant, while making sure that undesirable overlap is minimized. If you’re an industry veteran who wants to stop hiding new offerings in old wrappers with manual data fixes & overhead, we have a place for you.

Monitor current and proposed security changes impacting regulatory, privacy, and security industry best practice guidance. Support audit practices and processes and work with the IT organization to ensure findings are remediated. Document and capture qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess the success of the security program and provide regular reports to security and business leadership. Ensure security and technology teams maintain up-to-date configuration documentation for systems and processes.

        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The GTM Operations team is responsible for overall productivity and effectiveness of the sales organization, partnering closely with the sales team and teams across Stripe to drive initiatives. The Sales Strategy and Operations function at Stripe plays a crucial role in the success of our sales organization. With a commitment to excellence and a deep understanding of the art and science of sales, our team is dedicated to informing the sales strategy, optimizing processes, and providing insights that propel our sales growth. We do this by being objective, trusted partners to the Sales Leadership team. What you’ll do We are seeking a technically sophisticated and detailed oriented individual who will serve as a member of the Global Sales Strategy and Operations team. This person will be responsible for improving the quality of sales analytics and insights on a consistent basis, including standardization of reporting and scalability across all geos with the primary objective of enabling sales leadership to make effective, analytically driven decisions and by being a force multiplier for our RSSO and XFN operations peers and partners. Responsibilities Rhythm of Business Management: Design and execute on a standard cadence of operations which we refer to as the Go To Market (GTM) rhythm of business.

Provide actionable insight and strategic perspective on business performance to help inform key decisions across GTM teams.

Productivity and resource management: Collaborate with our Finance and Strategy team in modeling our GTM productivity, informing resource allocation and optimisation for the sales organization in partnership with our strategy and resource tracking teams in the GTM Operations organization. Who you are We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements 7+ years of work experience in business operations, finance, data science, investment banking or business analytics (or 4+ years work experience with Masters degree) Advanced SQL and Spreadsheet modeling experience Experience initiating and completing analytical projects with minimal guidance, taking a structured approach to solving unique business problems Has an enthusiastic “roll up your sleeves” mentality. Pragmatic problem solver, with a bias to action and “getting things done”. Passionate about driving business outcomes and change at the ground level. Experience presenting technical content to non-technical audiences and leadership. Courageous communicator translating business insights into practical recommendations. Preferred Qualifications Prior experience with Tableau data visualization. Experience with Salesforce - knowledge of Salesforce data management and system configuration mechanics and experience building Salesforce reports and dashboards. Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $140,700 - $211,100. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

        "description": "What You’ll Do At BTS BTS is a consultancy specializing in the people side of strategy. For over three decades we’ve been designing powerful experiences that have a profound and lasting impact on businesses and their people. We help the world’s leading companies turn strategy into results. Our next-generation approach combines deep business knowledge with transformational development to help people and their company evolve together. We equip leaders for tomorrow, inspire new ways of thinking, and build critical capabilities through targeted interventions, including working sessions, workshops, offsites, and more. As a Strategy Execution Consultant, you’ll work directly with leaders from the world’s leading and largest corporations. You’ll learn how their strategies and businesses work, and you’ll shape capabilities across the organization. We work in small teams to develop designed experiences - think customized business simulations with financial models, or app-based digital learning, – then we facilitate these engagements with our clients in a working session that incorporates humor, fun, and competition; and, you’re the facilitator and coach who makes these experiences impactful and memorable. There are no industry verticals at BTS, and you will work with a variety of clients on different types of projects. You’ll be staffed on multiple engagements at one time, across different industries, and with different internal teams. As a Strategy Execution Consultant, you will have the opportunity to work across our company’s areas of expertise: Strategic Alignment, Business Acumen, Sales & Marketing, and Leadership Development. When you’re not facilitating an offsite with your teammates, you’ll spend your time designing these amazing experiences - interviewing clients, conducting research and analysis, testing programs, and learning. This is all done in a team-based setting where our entrepreneurial culture of freedom and responsibility empowers you to contribute from your first day. As your skills and career grow, you’ll take on more responsibility to lead projects, manage client relationships, find new clients and opportunities to grow BTS’s business, and grow the careers of others BTSers. We have a hybrid work environment with expectations of being in the office 50% of the time when you’re not traveling. As for travel, we do that differently than most consulting firms: you’ll travel when you are leading clients through the designed experiences you and your teammates create.
