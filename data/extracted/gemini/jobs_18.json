This role provides a hybrid schedule, with two days required on-site. This position requires providing technical support through engineering judgment based on requirements provided by the Service Areas (SA) and information available through various FAA resources for NEXCOM Radio Deployment. What you will get to do: Verify the number of radios in the Site Requirement Form (submitted by Engineering Services) is correct by checking against the information available in the Site Survey Database (SSDB) Verify ancillary equipment request is reasonable and appropriate: Use engineering judgment to ensure that excessively high or low quantities of cables are not requested. Use the information available in the SSDB to check the number of towers/poles, cable runs, and distance to the facility. Use engineering judgment to ensure the appropriate number and type of antennae. Pay attention to the type of radios requested, the number of radios, and whether multicouplers are used. If a “receiver only” site exists, attention needs to be paid to using multicouplers. Ensure that the type of rack and number of racks requested are appropriate. The type of rack is determined by the type of facility and the services channels provide. Check the Cost Account Plan for accuracy in numbers provided in the CAP. The CAP provides a detailed cost of the total project and is used to determine the Purchase Authorization (PA) amount. Coordinate with appropriate team members to correct inconsistencies or when additional information is needed. Coordinate with Site Cost Monitor to provide total site cost estimates to the Radio Deployment Manager for his approval decision. Review the infrastructure design with attention to detail and determine if a more economical option is available, using engineering principles and knowledge. If the program manager requires, assist ES in additional site surveys. Collaborate with ES in optimizing equipment usage – use engineering expertise.

        "description": "Everyone deserves the opportunity to build a better future. This simple idea has been at the heart of TechnoServe’s work around the world for over 50 years. TechnoServe is a pioneer in leveraging the power of businesses and markets to create sustainable pathways out of poverty. The low-income communities in which we work are full of enterprising people. Their small-scale farms and businesses are the keys to economic development. But they face many challenges: low literacy, lack of access to jobs and markets, unpredictable political dynamics, and, increasingly, the effects of climate change. Without resources to combat threats like volatile weather patterns, worsening natural disasters, and crop and livestock diseases, these small-scale producers face lower incomes and higher risks as they struggle to earn a good living. TechnoServe is meeting this challenge with a bold commitment to help create a people-, nature-, and climate-positive world. Our Regenerate 30 initiative launched at COP27 aims to achieve the following impact by 2030: 30 million people with increased resilience, 30 million tons of CO2e mitigated or sequestered, 30 million acres of land under sustainable management or improved conservation and $300 million in private sector investment. The initiative will drive over $1 billion in financial benefits for smallholder farmers and businesses. Innovating with corporate partners to transform their global supply chains across their entire sourcing footprint while they work towards achieving net zero commitments is critical to achieving our Regenerate 30 vision. Program Overview: The program donor has made a corporate commitment of protecting and regenerating 1.5 million hectares of land, forests, and oceans by 2030 and has partnered with TechnoServe to deploy the Regenerative Agriculture Program, inspiring and supporting farmers and agribusinesses to engage in the journey towards regenerative production systems. This global program, funded through 2027, is an opportunity to collaborate with a leading company to demonstrate there is a future for a better, low-carbon, biodiverse, and profitable approach to farming. The program will collaborate with the donor’s suppliers across countries and various food ingredients and will make meaningful contributions to TechnoServe’s Regenerate 30 impact goals. This will require us to collaborate with the leading regenerative experts and practitioners in farming communities worldwide to support them in driving bottom-up change based on the local context.

Further, while employees of Headspace (formerly Ginger) cannot access Headspace products/services, they will be offered benefits according to the company's benefit plan. To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships. A dual relationship occurs when a mental health care provider has a second, significantly different relationship with their client in addition to the traditional client-therapist relationship—including, for example, a managerial relationship. As such, Headspace requests that individuals who have received coaching or clinical services at Headspace wait until their care with Headspace is complete before applying for a position. If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment. Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

        "description": "Summary: A successful, established Digital Media agency is seeking a Manager of Data & Analytics to join their Ad Platforms team. This position requires experience in a data-driven marketing or analytics role. Responsibilities : Spearhead the development and implementation of a performance measurement framework: Collaborate with clients and stakeholders to define campaign goals and objectives Select the most suitable technologies to support data collection, analysis, and visualization Develop a data architecture that facilitates data-driven decision making for all stakeholders throughout the campaign lifecycle Lead data analysis and reporting: Work collaboratively with a team of data analysts to develop comprehensive measurement strategies and define key performance indicators (KPIs) Translate data insights into actionable recommendations for media teams and other stakeholders Create and maintain clear and concise measurement plans to guide data collection and analysis efforts Conduct thorough quality assurance (QA) checks on dashboards and reports to ensure accuracy and functionality Manage relationships with data providers and analytics platforms, ensuring smooth communication and efficient operations Communicate insights and foster continuous improvement: Facilitate client calls and presentations, effectively communicating complex data insights in a clear and compelling manner Troubleshoot data discrepancies and implement solutions to uphold data integrity Stay abreast of industry trends and best practices in data analytics, visualization, media advertising, AdTech, and MarTech Provide mentorship to team members, contributing to their professional development in this dynamic field Qualifications: Experience in data analytics, performance measurement, or a related field Expertise in Google Campaign Manager, Google Ads, and Meta reporting tools, along with GA4 for comprehensive campaign analysis Strong analytical skills with experience in designing and implementing measurement frameworks Skilled in designing interactive dashboards and reports using data visualization tools (e.g., Domo, Tableau, Power BI, Looker) Solid understanding of client CRMs and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) to leverage audience data for effective targeting Strong leader and mentor, fostering a collaborative environment where data analysts can thrive and contribute their best work Excellent communication and presentation skills, with the ability to translate complex data insights for both technical and non-technical audiences Strong project management skills, including task prioritization, deadline management, and ensuring successful project completion A passion for continuous learning and staying informed about the latest trends in data analytics and the evolving marketing landscape This job is being represented by Media Recruiting Group, the premier recruiters for digital media, AdTech, MarTech, Media SaaS and related companies. In business for 25 years, we place quality at the heart of all that we do. Clients include: AdTech companies, Digital Publishers, Digital divisions of Media Companies, SaaS (Software as a Service) / Enterprise, Programmatic... Sell Side Platforms (SSP), Ad Exchanges, Demand Side Platforms (DSP), Marketing Technology companies, Ad Agencies, Data Providers, Aggregators, & DMP’s, Video, Social, Mobile companies, Behavioral Targeting companies, Media Buying Platforms, Lead Generation/Co-Registration companies, Ad Serving Platforms, Rich Media companies. Required Notification: Certain states require that job postings indicate a minimum and maximum base salary in an effort to not discriminate – a very worthwhile purpose that Media Recruiting Group supports. MRG’s practices are and have always been non-discriminatory, and jobs are open to all candidates with respect to race, color, religion, national origin, military status, sexual orientation, sex/gender, age, national origin, disability, etc. That said, companies require that we supply them with candidates with very specific experience, and the commensurate compensation for every job varies. It is a function of a person’s years of experience, type of experience, skills, knowledge of certain computer programs, etc. And every job may have a unique requirement. And every job could come in higher or lower than the range we are given. We do not control the upper and lower ranges for our clients, so we make a best efforts attempt to include information requested by said states. In the case of sales people, most time it is also a function of their contacts. If the job is an analyst, analytical skills and experience matter. Etc. This makes stating a reasonable minimum and maximum challenging absent all of this information about a given candidate. Companies also have other elements of compensation, including but not limited to, commission, bonus, equity, profit sharing, varying levels of healthcare coverage and how much a person would have to contribute to the premium, various perks like continuing education, commuter reimbursement, phone reimbursement, etc. – not included in “salary” as the law states. Thus, know that anything we note in a salary range does NOT include such other compensation elements. And, as recruiters, we don’t know what all of those elements are, as we are recruiting for a company, not for ourselves, and they do not brief us as to each benefit. We are a 3rd party and can only estimate to the best of our knowledge, and thus offer the minimum and maximum salary MRG in good faith believes at the time of the posting the client is willing to pay for the advertised job. Qualified by all of the above, for this job with requisite/required years of the required experience and skills, the minimum and maximum salary is approximated at $90,000 and $110,000 respectfully, exclusive of commission, bonus, equity, profit sharing, any element of healthcare coverage, any reference to how much a person would have to contribute to the premium of a healthcare plan, any perks, or other forms of compensation. Fewer years of experience could bring the base salary lower, and more experience could bring the base salary higher, if the company is willing to increase their salary bands.",

Team will be part of the E2E Fresh domain. E2E Fresh is responsible for perishable products like produce, meat, seafood and dairy. Specifically, this team will be responsible for data related to refrigerated supply chain, or Cold Chain as we call it. Cold Chain data includes data from temperature sensors, purchase orders, warehousing, and transportation routing and location. The overall goal is to use this data increase freshness of food at the stores. Ingestion pipelines for data from internal and external applications. Curation and presentation of application data to internal consumers. Join data from multiple systems to create Fresh Domain Data. \" Investigate and mitigate data quality issues. The Journey Of Data Enabling E2E Fresh Will Usually Follow a Path Of Analytics To Client Improvement Opportunities, Reporting To Allow Operations To Target Improvement, And Event (real-time) Data To Participate In Operations. A Hypothetical Example Would Be \" Analytics reveals that strawberries are frequently subjected to high temperatures in transit from distribution center to stores. Management knows they have a problem and assigns operations to investigate. \" Reports are given to operations managers to help them investigate and try an operational change like a temp check when the truck leaves the yard. Reports allow them to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the change on strawberry freshness. \" The changes might mitigate some instances but not all. So transportation and/or stores are given real time data. This will allow them to be alerted that a truck is en route to the store with a high temperature. They turn the truck around before it even hits the store's loading dock and a replacement order is processed. This saves employee time and speeds up the replenishment process, resulting in fresher strawberries in the store. What is the start date and expected duration?: ASAP start (ideally 6/24). Team will be durable for the foreseeable future. End date listed is just end of FY. Expect this team to continue next FY. NOTE: Hiring manager is on vacation Are there key milestones or deadlines that the team should be aware of?: KTD uses the OKR management model and for this upcoming quarter there is some discovery and ingestion. But typically the deliverables will be: integration pipelines of data sources, cross-domain data set creation, presentation of data via data lake or API. Candidate Meeting Time Block (reserved time on your calendar to meet with candidates): Potentially 6/28, 7/1. Manager would like to meet with Data Tech Lead candidates and Data Analyst candidates. May include 2 others from the team to participate in candidate meetings. Any specific location requirements?: Team members will be fully remote and can be anywhere in the US.
