        "created_on": 1720588590.6705446,
        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The Experimentation team provides infrastructure, tooling, and expertise for A/B testing at Stripe. We build the UIs and libraries for running and analyzing experiments, APIs for assignment, and manage tooling to create and maintain relevant metrics. We partner with teams like Payments, Fraud, ML, Website, and Documentation to develop experimentation programs that lift metrics or improve safety of code and model changes. The next few years are focused on bringing more teams onboard and scaling up our infrastructure to increase the reach of experiments across Stripe. What you’ll do You will work closely with software engineers, data scientists, PMs, and machine learning engineers to develop experimentation programs across Stripe that lift metrics or improve safety of code and model changes. You will build and maintain the A/B testing, reducing friction, scaling up, and adding features to meet the needs of these programs. Responsibilities Partnering with teams across Stripe to develop experimentation programs. Building powerful, flexible, and user-friendly infrastructure and tooling to power all experimentation at Stripe. Maintaining availability and latency requirements to power business critical applications. Who you are You have a strong background in running experiments or building experimentation platforms, and build quality software. You enjoy partnering with other teams, and are excited about solving complex business problems. You’re comfortable working on distributed teams with teammates, users, and dependencies in different locations. It’s not expected that any candidate would have expertise across every area. For instance, we have wonderful team members that have a lot of data science experience, but didn’t come in with as much systems knowledge. Minimum Requirements At least five years of experience building software applications in large scale distributed systems. At least two years of experience running A/B tests or building experimentation platforms. Experience running operations for high availability, low latency systems. Experience working through the full life cycle of software development, from talking to users, to design and implementation, to testing and deployment, to operations. Enjoy partnering with other teams to drive business outcomes. Preferred Qualifications Five years experience running A/B tests or building experimentation platforms. Familiarity with the data science of advanced experimentation, including multi-armed bandit testing. Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $136,800 - $244,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

        "description": "About Us Our mission is to reinvent the way people learn, starting with language. We begin by teaching the next billion people English, Spanish, and French. English is the global language of business, culture, and communication, and over 1.5 billion people around the world are actively trying to learn right now. Others dream of communicating with the half-billion native Spanish speakers across the globe. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to speak a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help – you need to actually converse with someone. Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered experience that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to. We started on this journey over five years ago and we've still got a long ways to go. We're thoughtfully adding new team members only when we think they can truly play a big role in our mission. Speak launched first in South Korea where we have quickly grown to become the top grossing education app in the country. We have now delivered this winning product to more than 30 countries globally and are continuing to expand to more markets in the coming months. The company is well funded, raising a recent Series B backed by investors like OpenAI, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, Lachy Groom, Josh Buckley, and others. We’re a team of 75 based primarily in SF, Seoul, Tokyo, and Ljubljana. About This Role We are looking for an experienced Machine Learning Engineer to join our team and help develop cutting-edge phoneme recognition models to provide learners with effective pronunciation feedback. In this role you will take ownership of the end-to-end modeling pipeline, from training and experimentation to deployment and monitoring. You will also work closely with Product teams to design innovative learning experiences and measure the efficacy of production models as they affect our end users. We are a small, dynamic team where you will likely also contribute as a developer and thought partner on broader team projects like ASR, assessment, content personalization, and much more. This is an incredibly exciting time to join an ML team designing a personalized learning experience that will revolutionize language learning for millions of learners worldwide — come join us! What You'll Be Doing Training and deploying phoneme recognition models end-to-end, including monitoring, performance tracking, and retraining Expanding our Pronunciation Coach to provide precise feedback and integrate more broadly across our learning platform Tracking metrics to measure performance of existing phoneme models across markets Building out an assessment system to provide nuanced feedback on pronunciation, intonation, prosody, and more Building and maintaining data infrastructure; i.e. audio data pipelines, training/evaluation datasets creation and management, labeling/active learning loop Supporting the broader Speech & ML team (e.g. developing and localizing ASR models) What We're Looking For Extensive experience training and deploying custom deep learning models to production (experience with audio/speech strongly preferred) Proficiency in Python and common Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch Strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders Sharp product sense and an ability to think broadly and cross-functionally about model quality in the context of user experience 4 - 10 years of industry experience Office San Francisco, CA Why work at Speak Join a fantastic, tight-knit team at the right time: we're growing very quickly, we've raised our Series B and an additional extension from some of the top investors in the valley, and we've achieved product-market fit in our initial markets. You'd join at a magical time when a single person could significantly change the course of the company. Do your life's work with people you’ll love working with: we care strongly about our craft and want every person at Speak to feel like they're growing every day. We believe in the idea that working with people you both enjoy and have respect for makes everything better. We hire thoughtfully and only work with people we admire deeply. Global in nature: We're live in over 40 countries and launching in a number of new markets soon. We have dedicated offices in San Francisco, Ljubljana, Seoul, and Tokyo, and you’ll have the opportunity to talk to users in each of these regions on a regular basis as well as travel. Impact people's lives in a major way: Learning a language is one of the single most life-changing skills one can learn, and right now 99% of people never achieve their goal because the process is broken. We’re helping millions of people achieve their goals and improve their lives.

Yet traditional search engines (cough, Google) don't feel magical -- they don't understand text at near-human level. It doesn't have to be this way. At our company, we're training foundational models for search. Our goal is to build systems that can instantly filter the world's knowledge to exactly what you want, no matter how complex your query. Search is a unique research problem within generative AI -- instead of generating a single piece of text, search involves asking the same questions about billions of texts. No other AI lab is exploring this direction. That means if we don't find novel methods for search, they won't be found. Our team has already made breakthroughs not seen in the literature, and we have more coming. Want to explore the search frontier with us? Code tutorials + examples: Researcher: Automatically research and generate comprehensive reports on any topic RAG: Use the platform to enable retrieval augmented generation Company Analyst: Automatically research and analyze companies and their competitors Recruiting agent: Discover, research, and evaluate exceptional candidates Recent News Summarizer: Identify and summarize the latest news on any topic Desired Experience You have graduate-level ML experience (or are an exceptionally strong undergrad) You can code up a transformer from scratch in pytorch You're comfortable creating large-scale datasets Care about the problem of finding high quality knowledge and recognize how important this is for the world Example Projects Train a 30B parameter version of our current model Build an RLAIF pipeline for search Dream up a novel architecture for search in the shower, then code it up and beat our best model's top score Compensation: Very flexible on this, depends on seniority and experience. $140k+ and substantial equity Who is Recruiting from Scratch: Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies.

        "description": "About Us Our mission is to reinvent the way people learn, starting with language. We begin by teaching the next billion people English, Spanish, and French. English is the global language of business, culture, and communication, and over 1.5 billion people around the world are actively trying to learn right now. Others dream of communicating with the half-billion native Spanish speakers across the globe. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to speak a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help – you need to actually converse with someone. Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered experience that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to. We started on this journey over five years ago and we've still got a long ways to go. We're thoughtfully adding new team members only when we think they can truly play a big role in our mission. Speak launched first in South Korea where we have quickly grown to become the top grossing education app in the country. We have now delivered this winning product to more than 30 countries globally and are continuing to expand to more markets in the coming months. The company is well funded, raising a recent Series B backed by investors like OpenAI, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, Lachy Groom, Josh Buckley, and others. We’re a team of 75 based primarily in SF, Seoul, Tokyo, and Ljubljana. About This Role As an MLE at Speak, you'll play a pivotal role in developing the future of language learning and creating the most effective path to language fluency. Your primary responsibility will be to spearhead new proofs-of-concept and experiment creatively to help push the boundaries of truly personalized language learning. Your tasks will span the entire ML lifecycle, from ideation and experimentation to implementation and deployment. You’ll bring the rigor of ML applied research to building out novel LLM product experiences to create new lesson types, to improve assessment/feedback, and to provide a continuously personalized learning experience to users. We're constantly pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can do to provide an exceptional and unparalleled language learning experience to users in over 30 countries worldwide. What you'll be doing Collaborating with the Content team to build out a Knowledge Graph to measure and track learner progress over time in Vocab, Grammar, and Pronunciation Building new types of dynamically-generated personalized lessons to teach to each individual learner’s strengths and weakness Working closely with the Product team to enhance our AI-powered lessons and learning features Improving the assessment and monitoring of our prompts via synthetic evaluators What we're looking for 3+ years experience as a machine learning engineer shipping ML systems into production Proficiency in Python Please apply if you have extensive experience building with LLMs, even if you’re more junior! Experience working with LLMs and strong LLM intuition Experience building and shipping complex LLM systems into production: evaluation, prompt engineering, prompt chaining, finetuning, etc. You’ve probably done several LLM hackathons, built several side projects, tried out many types of models, and use ChatGPT daily. Strong understanding of improving performance & output quality of LLM systems: i.e. prompting vs finetuning, evaluation, model selection, etc. Strong product interest and sense - ability to think broadly/cross-functionally about novel LLM-powered capabilities and product experiences Office San Francisco, CA Why work at Speak Join a fantastic, tight-knit team at the right time: we're growing very quickly, we've raised our Series B and an additional extension from some of the top investors in the valley, and we've achieved product-market fit in our initial markets. You'd join at a magical time when a single person could significantly change the course of the company. Do your life's work with people you’ll love working with: we care strongly about our craft and want every person at Speak to feel like they're growing every day. We believe in the idea that working with people you both enjoy and have respect for makes everything better. We hire thoughtfully and only work with people we admire deeply. Global in nature: We're live in over 40 countries and launching in a number of new markets soon. We have dedicated offices in San Francisco, Ljubljana, Seoul, and Tokyo, and you’ll have the opportunity to talk to users in each of these regions on a regular basis as well as travel. Impact people's lives in a major way: Learning a language is one of the single most life-changing skills one can learn, and right now 99% of people never achieve their goal because the process is broken. We’re helping millions of people achieve their goals and improve their lives.

        "description": "We are Universe Energy, and we are the battery dismantling and repurposing company. Our mission is to scale battery reuse as the largest source of the next billion batteries. The world needs 2 billion batteries by 2050, but this comes at a huge cost to the planet, as we need to mine 30x more. We dismantle and sort used battery packs 7x faster and 50% cheaper than by hand using robotics, AI and sound for EV OEMs, battery makers and fleets. Once we dismantle 1000s of battery packs, we repurpose them into $4000 cheap grid batteries that are 20% cheaper than making new ones. Our vision is to become the leading maker of zero-impact batteries by building 1 million batteries/year by 2035. This will power a truly clean energy revolution at scale and reduce 6 Giga tons of CO2 by 2050. We are Universe Energy, and we make batteries eternal. The Bonobo Robot dismantles batteries. We are building a cognitive robot that we call Bonobo that automatically diagnose, discharge, and disassemble EV batteries using robotic manipulation, autonomous controls, and computer vision. The first-generation robotic system will automatically assess the battery's state of health, remove covers from arbitrary battery packs (500 kg), and perform safe discharging. It then disassembles these batteries from the pack level (500 kg) down to the module level (25 kg). Bonobo can take batteries apart 4x faster and safer than a human at 6x the throughput, leading to 50% lower unit economics. Job objective You will conceptualize, architect, engineer, and deploy algorithms that allow the robot to see and recognize the configuration of EV battery packs. The perception system then tells the robot what it sees and identifies parts like connectors, welding seams, and modules. You will scan the battery packs and cells to decide on their health by analyzing images from battery cell material. Then it instructs the Bonobo robot how to take these apart. You will then validate the software with what the cameras and sensors on the Bonobo preceive. How you will contribute Develop production-level & robust computer vision modules for classification, counting, tracking, 3D reconstruction, camera calibration, and segmentation. Research and implement machine perception & visual understanding of battery systems to enable counting, detection, localization, and labeling. Recognize, analyze, and process images of scans of battery cells from non-intrusive methods such as X-ray, CT-scan, and ultrasound. Build perception software that integrates computer vision, sensor fusion, decision-making functions, and structures data-set generation. Develop and implement classical and learning-based computer vision on real-time platforms. Perform sensor selection for the camera perception system like RGB, infrared, and laser scan. Develop sensor-fusion and decision-making algorithms. Generate datasets for algorithm training from the real world and through synthetic methods. Build software & ML infrastructure for machine perception capabilities. The Skills & Experience That You Bring At least a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, or a similar field. Academic background in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, classical Computer vision, Image recognition, and Perception systems. 3+ yrs experience in developing software with strong skills in C/C++, Python, and Matlab-Simulink and have developed software from architecture to production-level code in software, machine learning, and perception environments. 3+ yrs experience in developing ML tools in Torch/TensorFlow built and Classical computer vision algorithms in C++ and OpenCV. 3 yrs hands-on experience with optical, image sensor, or camera calibration, and their associated computer vision principles to process this data. 1-3 experience in generating, filtering, and augmenting large image datasets for computer vision. 1-3 yrs experience developing, training, and testing deep-learning-based algorithms for detection, counting, classification, segmentation, and tracking. How to hit a homerun A track record of relevant academic publications, patents, and/or open-source software in machine learning and/or computer vision. Hands-on experience processing rich sensor data from LIDAR, RADAR, and cameras in environments captured by autononous vehicles. Experience in 3D graphics, focusing on 3D geometry manipulation (Vis-Rep, B-rep geometry representations) & Game engine experience in Unity3D (C#) or Unreal Engine (C++). Hands-on experience with building autonomous and/or robotic systems is a plus. Reach out to careers@universeenergy.ai for questions, comments and/or feedback before applying.",

        "description": "Who We Are At City Storage Systems, we're building Infrastructure for Better Food. We help restaurateurs around the world succeed in online food delivery. Our goal is to make food more affordable, higher quality and convenient for everyone. We're changing the game for restaurateurs, whether they’re entrepreneurs opening their first restaurant all the way through to your favorite global quick-service restaurant chains. What You’ll Do As a critical member of our Machine Learning infrastructure team, your main responsibilities will be to work closely with a small and talented group of software engineers to build an exceptional Machine Learning infrastructure that everyone in the company will use on a daily basis. You will have the opportunity to define and execute your own vision of creating a holistic and forward-looking platform with the ambitious goal of making a significant impact on the entire industry. We are not just here to follow trends but to set them! Your day-to-day will be focused on building rather than sitting in meetings, as we value hands-on work and getting things done. Join us on this exciting journey, and let’s make a difference together! Who We’re Looking For An engineer with extensive experience in building distributed data-heavy systems at scale who has a passion for machine learning and ideally has experience building machine learning platforms. It would be great if you actively participate in an Open Source community within the Data/ML ecosystems, as we are big believers in OSS. You are comfortable using or learning our primary programming languages, Java, Go, and Python. We operate everything on Kubernetes (and we did write our own operators), and our current engine of choice for training and inference is Ray. While it’s not mandatory, it would be beneficial if you have some familiarity with cloud offerings (Azure, GCP, …). While we don’t believe years of experience are everything, to become an expert in the Data field you will need at least 10 years in the weeds or extraordinary accomplishments. We understand that you may not have experience with all the technologies we use, but if you’re eager to learn, contribute to pushing the industry forward, and have fun along the way, we would love to have a conversation with you. Why join us Growing market: You’ll be focused on an $80 billion market that’s projected to reach at least $500 billion by 2030 in the US alone. Changing the food industry: You’ll be part of a team that helps restaurants succeed in online food delivery. Leadership support: You will receive support and guidance from experienced colleagues and managers, helping you to learn, grow and achieve your goals, and you’ll work closely with other teams to ensure our customer’s success. What Else You Need To Know This role is based in our Mountain View (SFBA), California office location. We understand the value of collaboration and believe that people thrive when they have other team members around them. As a company that thrives on innovation and constant improvement, we are dedicated to changing the industry, inventing new products and processes, and staying ahead of the curve. When you’re constantly innovating, changing how an industry works, inventing new products and processes - and we are doing all these things - we believe we’re better as a team in-person. That’s why all of our teams (except for our field-based roles) are now working from one of our office locations 5 days a week. Looking forward to sharing more about a Career of Substance at City Storage Systems. Ready to join us as we serve those who serve others?

        "description": "The world will be unrecognisable in 5 years. Machine learning models are driving our cars, testing our eyesight, detecting our cancer, giving sight to the blind, giving speech to the mute, and dictating what we consume, enjoy, and think. These AI systems are already an integral part of our lives and will shape our future as a species. Soon, we'll conjure unlimited content: from never-ending TV series (where we’re the main character) to personalised tutors that are infinitely patient and leave no student behind. We’ll augment our memories with foundation models—individually tailored to us through RLHF and connected directly to our thoughts via Brain-Machine Interfaces—blurring the lines between organic and machine intelligence and ushering in the next generation of human development. This future demands immense, globally accessible, uncensorable, computational power. Gensyn is the machine learning compute protocol that translates machine learning compute into an always-on commodity resource—outside of centralised control and as ubiquitous as electricity—accelerating AI progress and ensuring that this revolutionary technology is accessible to all of humanity through a free market. Our Principles: AUTONOMY Don’t ask for permission - we have a constraint culture, not a permission culture. Claim ownership of any work stream and set its goals/deadlines, rather than waiting to be assigned work or relying on job specs. Push & pull context on your work rather than waiting for information from others and assuming people know what you’re doing. No middle managers - we don’t (and will likely never) have middle managers. FOCUS Small team - misalignment and politics scale super-linearly with team size. Small protocol teams rival much larger traditional teams. Thin protocol - build and design thinly. Reject waste - guard the company’s time, rather than wasting it in meetings without clear purpose/focus, or bikeshedding . REJECT MEDIOCRITY Give direct feedback to everyone immediately rather than avoiding unpopularity, expecting things to improve naturally, or trading short-term pain for extreme long-term pain. Embrace an extreme learning rate rather than assuming limits to your ability/knowledge. Responsibilities: System Design: develop an elegant system for orchestrating machine learning execution to enable training across our uniquely decentralised and heterogeneous infrastructure. Performance Optimisation: continuously profile and optimise training algorithms to ensure peak performance. Research and Development: implement novel research and build out new mechanisms and algorithms to solve open distributed ML training problems. Engineering Support: collaborate with the team on broader ML-related issues, such as reproducible training. Documentation and Communication: contribute to technical reports and papers for publication within the wider ML community. Minimum Requirements: Parallel Training Experience: proven experience in parallelising training for a wide range of models on different types of hardware and network topologies. Distributed Training Expertise: hands-on experience designing training systems on large clusters, using various parallelisation models (pipeline, data, tensor parallelism), training modes (local optimisation, global optimisation), and optimisation techniques (quantisation, gradient compression, etc.). Networking Knowledge: deep understanding and experience with common networking protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP) and communication backends (NCCL, GLOO, MPI). Computer Science Background: strong understanding of computational complexity (time, space) and broad knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Applied Research Experience: comfortable working in an applied research environment with high autonomy and unpredictable timelines, requiring a high degree of collaboration and communication. Nice to haves: Rust: strong experience with systems programming in Rust (you know what a 'lifetime' is and understand the purpose of Pin). Open source work: experience working with large open source codebases - either as maintainer or trusted contributor. Research background: published research in the distributed systems or ML domains. Blockchain: understanding of blockchain fundamentals. Compensation / Benefits: Competitive salary + share of equity and token pool Fully remote work - we hire between the West Coast (PT) and Central Europe (CET) time zones Relocation Assistance - available for those that would like to relocate after being hired (anywhere from PST through CET time zones) 4x all expenses paid company retreats around the world, per year Whatever equipment you need Paid sick leave Private health, vision, and dental insurance - including spouse/dependents [🇺🇸 only]",

For decades, legacy data leak prevention (DLP) solutions have failed to adequately protect sensitive information. Traditional DLP is outdated, intrusive, and complex - it wasn't designed for today's modern enterprise where users continuously share data across interconnected SaaS applications, endpoints, and now generative AI. Nightfall AI is the first AI-native DLP solution. We leverage AI to achieve twice the accuracy with a fraction of the false positives that overwhelm security teams. Nightfall does this without disrupting modern work patterns. Our AI-native platform spans sensitive data protection across SaaS, email, data exfiltration prevention on SaaS, endpoints, and data encryption.

As a leading enterprise technology company, our product affects the personal data that people entrust businesses to store & process with care every day. Critical data in modern organizations is often sprayed across a broad set of cloud data silos, and it's a herculean task for security & compliance teams to monitor, manage, and protect this highly sensitive data. Via machine learning, our product makes it easy for organizations to discover, classify, and protect this sensitive data across their cloud footprint - such as their corporate SaaS, data infrastructure, and even their own apps. In doing so, we prevent data leakage, provide unprecedented data visibility & protection across the cloud, and enable compliance.

        "description": "Nightfall AI (www.nightfall.ai) is the unified platform that prevents data leaks and enables secure collaboration by protecting sensitive data and controlling how it's shared. For decades, legacy data leak prevention (DLP) solutions have failed to adequately protect sensitive information. Traditional DLP is outdated, intrusive, and complex - it wasn't designed for today's modern enterprise where users continuously share data across interconnected SaaS applications, endpoints, and now generative AI. Nightfall AI is the first AI-native DLP solution. We leverage AI to achieve twice the accuracy with a fraction of the false positives that overwhelm security teams. Nightfall does this without disrupting modern work patterns. Our AI-native platform spans sensitive data protection across SaaS, email, data exfiltration prevention on SaaS, endpoints, and data encryption. Nightfall's Developer Platform provides an open, flexible environment for developers to integrate our data classification and protection capabilities anywhere, including establishing trust boundaries for AI model building and consumption. As a Backend Engineer at Nightfall, you'll enable us to deliver our platform reliably, securely, and at massive scale and ship exciting new features. You'll help build low latency, real-time microservices that process & detect sensitive data at scale and build products that are directly used by our customers. This is a 6 month contract position with a requirement to be in our San Francisco office on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Responsibilities: You will work closely with a set of talented engineers, product managers and designers to identify customer needs and build innovative solutions to solve them Quickly ramp up on existing features and be responsible for shipping new features into production Work on the latest technologies to reconstruct the future of ML based data security Qualifications: Current/recent BS or MS in Computer Science or Computer Engineering with a Graduation Year between Dec 2023 and June 2024 0-2 years of full time working experience 2+ Internships / Co-ops Passion for delivering quality end-user facing products Experienced with one of the following languages: Go, Rust, Python, C/C++ or any other similar programming language Familiarity with deployment and writing tests Ability to work with a team of engineers, designers, and product managers Excitement for taking on projects that directly impact our enterprise customers Willingness to operate in a fast-paced environment Prioritizes career growth Tools We Use: Go AWS Docker Kubernetes SQL/NoSQL databases About Nightfall: Nightfall is a cybersecurity startup dedicated to helping organizations secure and manage their sensitive data. As a leading enterprise technology company, our product affects the personal data that people entrust businesses to store & process with care every day. Critical data in modern organizations is often sprayed across a broad set of cloud data silos, and it's a herculean task for security & compliance teams to monitor, manage, and protect this highly sensitive data. Via machine learning, our product makes it easy for organizations to discover, classify, and protect this sensitive data across their cloud footprint - such as their corporate SaaS, data infrastructure, and even their own apps. In doing so, we prevent data leakage, provide unprecedented data visibility & protection across the cloud, and enable compliance. We're a technology startup founded in San Francisco, well-funded by leading institutional investors like Bain and Venrock, and a cadre of security & IT leaders from Okta, Salesforce, Atlassian, Splunk, FireEye, and more.
