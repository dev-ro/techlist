        "description": "OVERVIEW : Hey, I'm Will — Rumor has it I'm Denver's #1 Most Bald-est 👨‍🦲 Startup #DevRecruiter. As an agency recruiter, my team and I are actively and continually partnered with an ever-changing rolodex of VC Backed Startups & Growth Phase Tech Co's who are looking to Hire \"Uncommonly Good\" Senior, Lead, Staff & Principal Software Devs, 0-1 Founding Engineers , and \"hands-on\" (coding) Software Engineering Leaders. *In interest of YOUR time, and the roles we are most often seeing, we are currently ONLY targeting conversations candidates with notable, specialized production experience in Python & Django OR Robotics & C++ OR Machine Learning / AI. THE COMPANIES : We are currently working with several different startups, each looking for different versions of what you might universally call a \" Founding Engineer\". To give you a general sense of our clients, we specialize in working VC backed SaaS and tech companies hiring for concept, growth, maturation, profitability, or looking for acquisition. Most often our clients are: A) early-stage ( Pre-Seed ) startups hiring to build MVPs B) companies with established customers who are expanding their GTM ( Seed) C) growth & expansion growth-phase companies ( Series A through Series D ) E) self-funded, private & PE backed \" startup-esque \" companies hiring for optimization of established products or building new greenfield products within their orgs. THE LOCATIONS : Most of our clients at this time are looking to hire developers who are based in Denver/Boulder , San Francisco, or in NYC. In interest of YOUR time, we are ONLY targeting conversations with engineers who are currently based in the above 3 areas. (NOTE: A few of our clients do offer fully Remote jobs (from anywhere in the US), and we also work from occasionally on roles that are Hybrid in LA, San Diego, Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Washington DC, Austin, Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas-Ft. Worth. If you are based in the US but NOT in the above 3 areas, please keep an eye out for other job postings and we would be happy to consider you for those!) THE MONEY & BENEFITS : Most of our Denver/Boulder clients are offering a base salary between $150,000 - $225,000 and a few in NY and SF pay as high as $250,000+ salary. Target equity most often falls between 0.5% to 3% of the company, with the chance to turn the salary and equity levers up or down, inverse of one another. SHOULD YOU APPLY? With few exceptions, the folks we are able to hire check EACH of the following 4 boxes: 1. Previous VC Backed Early Stage and/or or 0-1 Founding Engineer Experience (Our clients are generally looking folks who have already helped 1-3 VC backed startups find product-market fit or grow significantly. If you have been one a founder, or one of the first 5 developers on a VC backed team and helped the company grow to 20+ devs through 1-2 rounds of funding, one of our clients might be a fit. On the contrary, we are NOT looking for folks coming from large, traditional, enterprise companies. Unfortunately resumes with a strong history from traditional, enterprise companies will be disregarded) 2. Five+ Years of Full Stack Experience in at least 1 of the Major MODERN Tech Stacks (We specialize in Senior+ dev roles. We see a TON of roles looking for some combination of greenfield, architecture, leadership, design and development experience. Almost all of our roles are looking for deep hands-on specialization with one of the following: Python/Django, C++/Robotics, and of course several now looking for ML, AI, and LLMs and adjacent tech... We do also see roles in other tech stacks i.e. Javascript, TypeScript/Node.js/Next.js, React, React Native AWS, Rust, Golang, Ruby/Rail/Elixir so we *may* consider strong resumes that specialize there. FYI, we are NOT looking for a specialization in enterprise languages like C#/.NET or Java: Unfortunately, resumes with less than 5 years experience or resumes that focus in C#/.NET or Java or enterprise tech stacks will be disregarded) 3. Diverse Product Engineering / Product Development / Team Lead Experience (Most of our clients are looking significant responsibility in making product and technology decisions, and you’ll most likely be expected to wear many hats, including taking on the toughest IC work facing the team as well as key leadership experience like helping hire, mentor and lead junior, mid, and senior engineers through the companies iterative growth. Unfortunately, resumes that do not demonstrate both strong previous work as an IC and potential for team leadership will be disregarded) 4. Passion for Startups & a 'Whatever it Takes\" Mindset (Our clients are looking for folks who have the desire to be \"all in\" with an ownership mentality. They plan to give you significant equity and ownership, and in return they are looking for you to take ownership, work fast, iterate fast, and do it while balancing speed vs. perfection in what are traditionally ambiguous and fast changing cultures. Unfortunately, resumes that do not demonstrate both strong interest and both past experience with startups will be disregarded) NEXT STEPS : We understand these requirements are strict... Our clients hold a strict bar for us, and as such we must carry that on for folks we consider for their roles. If the above description sounds like you, and excites you I'd LOVE to connect and chat further about what YOU are looking for in YOUR ideal next opportunity, and see if any of the roles I'm working on currently (or just as likely, down the road) would be an upward move for you. Please make each of 4 items above CLEAR in your resume. I do go through each and every resume that comes in but I only reach out to those that are a CLEAR fit. If the above requirements do NOT match your experience, we welcome you to keep an eye out for other job postings we bring and we would be happy to consider you for those other roles. You are welcome to send me a connection request or note on LinkedIn, but please know that I get a LOT of messages on LinkedIn (mostly automated and AI) so please start your message with \"I've got all 4\" which will make you much more likely to get a response :) Cheers, -Will p.s. You are welcome to send me a connection request or note on LinkedIn, but please know that I get a LOT of messages on LinkedIn (mostly automated and AI) so please start your message with \"I've got all 4\" which will make you much more likely to get a response :) .... If you REALLY REALLY want to stand out, send me a list of the Funding Stage & YOUR Your Hire # when you started, then the Funding Stage and Team Size when you left each of your past companies. Example: Company A: Pre-Seed, 1st Dev Hire → Series A, 23 Total Devs Company B: Seed, 3rd Dev Hire → Series B, 41 Total Devs Company C: Technical Co-Founder, 1st Overall Hire → Seed, 6 Total Devs",

        "created_on": 1720619506.600148,
        "description": "About Us Our mission is to reinvent the way people learn, starting with language. We begin by teaching the next billion people English, Spanish, and French. English is the global language of business, culture, and communication, and over 1.5 billion people around the world are actively trying to learn right now. Others dream of communicating with the half-billion native Spanish speakers across the globe. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to speak a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help – you need to actually converse with someone. Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered experience that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to. We started on this journey over five years ago and we've still got a long ways to go. We're thoughtfully adding new team members only when we think they can truly play a big role in our mission. Speak launched first in South Korea where we have quickly grown to become the top grossing education app in the country. We have now delivered this winning product to more than 30 countries globally and are continuing to expand to more markets in the coming months. The company is well funded, raising a recent Series B backed by investors like OpenAI, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, Lachy Groom, Josh Buckley, and others. We’re a team of 75 based primarily in SF, Seoul, Tokyo, and Ljubljana. About This Role As an AI Product Engineer at Speak, you'll play a pivotal role in developing the future of language learning and creating the most effective path to language fluency. Your primary responsibility will be developing innovative product experiences powered by Language Learning Models (LLMs) and deploying them to millions of users. Your tasks will span the full stack and beyond, from evaluating models and testing prompts to developing and iterating on various product features such as our conversational onboarding and lesson experiences, grammatical assessment and feedback, and personalized lessons. We're constantly pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can do to provide an exceptional and unparalleled language learning experience to users in over 30 countries worldwide. What you'll be doing Developing and deploying LLM-powered language learning products across the full stack, as well as enhancing the quality and performance of existing AI-powered features within Speak Collaborating cross-functionally with other Engineering teams, Applied ML, Product, Design, and Content Refining our process for building LLM apps, including best practices for prompting, experimentation/evaluation, LLM Ops, measuring quality and performance, etc. Scaling existing product features to many more users and languages What we're looking for 3-5+ years of experience in full stack/backend, product-focused software engineering Proficiency in React/Node/Typescript and Python Strong product intuition — the ability to think broadly and cross-functionally about innovative LLM-powered capabilities and product experiences Ability to work independently and build at a high velocity Interest in building with LLMs You may have participated in LLM hackathons, developed several side projects, experimented with different types of models, and use ChatGPT daily Bonus You have real-world experience developing and deploying LLM apps and a strong understanding, gained through experience, of what works and what doesn't A keen intuition for improving performance and output quality of LLM systems Experience with LLM Ops and tools (e.g., vector databases, RAG, prompt ops) Office San Francisco, CA Why work at Speak Join a fantastic, tight-knit team at the right time: we're growing very quickly, we've raised our Series B and an additional extension from some of the top investors in the valley, and we've achieved product-market fit in our initial markets. You'd join at a magical time when a single person could significantly change the course of the company. Do your life's work with people you’ll love working with: we care strongly about our craft and want every person at Speak to feel like they're growing every day. We believe in the idea that working with people you both enjoy and have respect for makes everything better. We hire thoughtfully and only work with people we admire deeply. Global in nature: We're live in over 40 countries and launching in a number of new markets soon. We have dedicated offices in San Francisco, Ljubljana, Seoul, and Tokyo, and you’ll have the opportunity to talk to users in each of these regions on a regular basis as well as travel. Impact people's lives in a major way: Learning a language is one of the single most life-changing skills one can learn, and right now 99% of people never achieve their goal because the process is broken. We’re helping millions of people achieve their goals and improve their lives.

Now, AI models can now natively understand and generate videos, songs, text and more. Traditional analytics platforms like Amplitude can only track clicks and swipes, leaving product teams in the dark. We make anything — what users are asking for, the rhythm of a song generated, the type of image they uploaded — as easy to track as a button click. This enables product teams to actually understand user behavior and learn why users are churning, how to increase growth, and more. As part of the founding team, you’ll play a fundamental role in shaping the company - from making strategy and product decisions, to helping scale the team, to shaping the future of AI products. Our Investors We’re backed by incredible investors including Y Combinator, James Tamplin (Founder of Firebase), Guillermo Rauch (Founder of Vercel), Balaji Srinivasan (Former CTO @ Coinbase), Matt MacInnis (COO @ Rippling), and amazing folks from Figma, Scale, OpenAI, Worldcoin, Apple, and more.

We don't reject ideas because they haven't worked before. We understand \"why did certain things work?\" and apply it to our situation. Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don't fixate on the finish line. Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback. Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn't know it was impossible. We're also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues.

        "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. You want to build large scale ML systems from the ground up. You care about making safe, steerable, trustworthy systems. As a Research Engineer, you'll touch all parts of our code and infrastructure, whether that's making the cluster more reliable for our big jobs, improving throughput and efficiency, running and designing scientific experiments, or improving our dev tooling. You're excited to write code when you understand the research context and more broadly why it's important. Note: This is an \"evergreen\" role that we keep open on an ongoing basis. We receive many applications for this position, and you may not hear back from us directly if we do not currently have an open role on any of our teams that matches your skills and experience. We encourage you to apply despite this, as we are continually evaluating for top talent to join our team. You are also welcome to reapply as you gain more experience, but we suggest only reapplying once per year. We may also put up separate, team-specific job postings . In those cases, the teams will give preference to candidates who apply to the team-specific postings, so if you are interested in a specific team please make sure to check for team-specific job postings! You May Be a Good Fit If You Have significant software engineering experience Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!) Want to learn more about machine learning research Care about the societal impacts of your work Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience With High performance, large-scale ML systems GPUs, Kubernetes, Pytorch, or OS internals Language modeling with transformers Reinforcement learning Large-scale ETL Representative Projects Optimizing the throughput of a new attention mechanism Comparing the compute efficiency of two Transformer variants Making a Wikipedia dataset in a format models can easily consume Scaling a distributed training job to thousands of GPUs Writing a design doc for fault tolerance strategies Creating an interactive visualization of attention between tokens in a language model Annual Salary The expected salary range for this position is: $280,000 — $625,000 USD Logistics Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. Compensation and Benefits* Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates. Equity - For eligible roles , equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance. US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents. 401(k) plan with 4% matching. 22 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness. Fertility benefits via Carrot. Daily lunches and snacks in our office. Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area. UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents. Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary). 21 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Health cash plan. Life insurance and income protection. Daily lunches and snacks in our office. This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

        "created_on": 1720619616.453719,
        "description": "About Retool Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don’t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows. At Retool, we’re on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We’re building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that’s a mission worth striving for. Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know! WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU Retool started as a way to address obstacles with internal tools and has grown into a company that solves internal tooling for thousands of companies (big and small). We’ve done a lot with a little: we have a growing engineering team and a laundry list of features and foundational improvements we want to tackle. To continue our fast-paced growth, we need to build a world-class engineering team. You’ll help us get there by unlocking a powerful new set of capabilities for Retool engineers and our customers. AI is rapidly changing the complexion and capabilities of modern software engineering; Retool presents an incredible opportunity to explore how AI-powered tooling can supercharge application development and overall customer productivity. What You'll Do We’re a tool built by engineers, for engineers. You'll work on features that impact Retool builders globally and have the power to change how applications are built across all parts of the stack. You’ll meet with internal counterparts to enhance customer thinking and partner closely with product on building out features. Your work plays a pivotal role in enhancing existing functionality and shipping new features — optimizing the performance of our customers' applications at every turn. Retool is built primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript, Node.js on the backend, and React on the frontend. While experience with these technologies is applicable to this role (React less so), LLM/model-related work will also entail a significant data wrangling component (Python.) Beyond building, you’ll also engage in technical decision-making with the team, participate in planning, and help our engineering team expand its skillset. To that end, you’ll also play a key role in helping us grow the team through interviewing potential new team members. Who You'll Work With As an engineer, you will work closely with product and design teams to build, ship, and iterate new features. We’re a hard-working, passionate bunch who are motivated by collaboration, strong results, and bringing the impact of Retool to our customers. When we’re in the office, we enjoy eating lunch (and occasionally dinner!) together, and we’ve been known for our lively game nights. But at the root of it all, we come together to show our customers — and not-quite-yet customers — how Retool can make them and their companies more efficient and successful. If this sounds like a fit, we’d love to hear from you! IN THIS ROLE YOU'LL Develop tailored models with Retool’s proprietary data, enabling customers to rapidly create Retool applications and workflows, powered by AI. Collaborate on data infrastructure, data pipelines, and other data-intensive tasks in support of Retool model development/evaluation. Fine-tune LLMs for specific applications such as code generation, text summarization, and translation. Design, develop, and eval prompts to guide the behavior of large language models (LLMs). Work closely with colleagues through Retool to develop and deploy LLM-powered applications. This may involve integrating LLMs into existing systems, or building new applications from scratch. Stay up-to-date on the latest research and developments in prompt engineering and LLM fine-tuning. The Skillset You'll Bring 6+ years experience in professional software development 3+ years experience in AI/AI-adjacent technologies (ML, recommendation/ranking, natural language) You have strong programming and data science fundamentals You’re comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL, and data wrangling generally You’re self-directed and comfortable working autonomously You’re able to work with ambiguity, helping navigate to successful outcomes NICE TO HAVE Real-world experience with LLM prompt tuning and automated/empirical eval Experience working with and fine-tuning Large Language Models Experience building scalable applications with LLMs, using frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc. Retool offers generous benefits to all employees and hybrid work location.

        "description": "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded by Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015 to help solve some of society’s toughest challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education to addressing the needs of our local communities. Our mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone. The Team Founded by Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a new kind of philanthropy that’s leveraging technology to help solve some of the world’s toughest challenges – from eradicating disease, to improving education, to reforming the criminal justice system. Our mission is to create a future for everyone. Across our core Initiative focus areas of Science and Education, we’re pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone. Our Values We believe we can help build a future for everyone. We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress. We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries. Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society’s challenges like those who live them every day. Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic background The Opportunity By pairing engineers with leaders in our science and education teams, we can bring AI/ML technology to the table in new ways to help drive solutions. We are uniquely positioned to design, build, and scale software systems to help educators, scientists, and policy experts better address the myriad challenges they face. Our technology team is already helping schools bring personalized learning tools to teachers and schools across the country. We are also supporting scientists around the world as they develop a comprehensive reference atlas of all cells in the human body, and are developing the capacity to apply state-of-the-art methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve important problems in the biomedical sciences. The AI/ML and Data Engineering Infrastructure organization works on building shared tools and platforms to be used across all of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, partnering and supporting the work of a wide range of Research Scientists, Data Scientists, AI Research Scientists, as well as a broad range of Engineers focusing on Education and Science domain problems. Members of the shared infrastructure engineering team have an impact on all of CZI's initiatives by enabling the technology solutions used by other engineering teams at CZI to scale. A person in this role will build these technology solutions and help to cultivate a culture of shared best practices and knowledge around core engineering. What You'll Do Participate in the technical design and building of efficient, stable, performant, scalable and secure AI/ML and Data infrastructure engineering solutions.

        "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About The Role You want to build and run elegant and thorough machine learning experiments to help us understand and steer the behavior of powerful AI systems. You care about making AI helpful, honest, and harmless, and are interested in the ways that this could be challenging in the context of human-level capabilities. You could describe yourself as both a scientist and an engineer. As a Research Engineer on Alignment Science, you'll contribute to exploratory experimental research on AI safety, with a focus on risks from powerful future systems (like those we would designate as ASL-3 or ASL-4 under our Responsible Scaling Policy ), often in collaboration with other teams including Interpretability, Fine-Tuning, and the Frontier Red Team. These papers give a simple overview of the topics the Alignment Science team works on: Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training , Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions , Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers , Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know , Measuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models , Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning , Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations . Note: Currently, the team has a preference for candidates who are able to be based in the Bay Area. However, we remain open to any candidate who can travel 25% to the Bay Area. Representative Projects Testing the robustness of our safety techniques by training language models to subvert our safety techniques, and seeing how effective they are at subverting our interventions. Run multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments to test out techniques like AI Debate . Build tooling to efficiently evaluate the effectiveness of novel LLM-generated jailbreaks. Write scripts and prompts to efficiently produce evaluation questions to test models’ reasoning abilities in safety-relevant contexts. Contribute ideas, figures, and writing to research papers, blog posts, and talks. Run experiments that feed into key AI safety efforts at Anthropic, like the design and implementation of our Responsible Scaling Policy . You May Be a Good Fit If You Have significant software, ML, or research engineering experience Have some experience contributing to empirical AI research projects Have some familiarity with technical AI safety research Prefer fast-moving collaborative projects to extensive solo efforts Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Care about the impacts of AI Strong Candidates May Also Have experience authoring research papers in machine learning, NLP, or AI safety Have experience with LLMs Have experience with reinforcement learning Have experience with Kubernetes clusters and complex shared codebases Candidates Need Not Have 100% of the skills needed to perform the job Formal certifications or education credentials Annual Salary The expected salary range for this position is: $280,000 — $625,000 USD Logistics Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. Compensation and Benefits* Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates. Equity - For eligible roles , equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance. US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents. 401(k) plan with 4% matching. 22 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness. Fertility benefits via Carrot. Daily lunches and snacks in our office. Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area. UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents. Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary). 21 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Health cash plan. Life insurance and income protection. Daily lunches and snacks in our office. This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

        "description": "About Us: Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses. We’re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Floodgate, Y Combinator, DNX Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Justin Kan, Elad Gil, and more. We value diversity — in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguide’s team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth. As an early stage start-up employee, you’ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitioners’ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide. ‍ The following should describe you: You want to join an early stage company: We're young, but we've found strong demand for our products and are growing quickly. We've landed numerous top audit and advisory firms as customers, displaced entrenched legacy technology, and have high demand for product access. You believe that great design and UX are requirements: We bring a user-centered approach to problem solving, focusing deeply on our customers. We're competing with legacy software that was built in the 1990's. These products have extremely low user satisfaction, but are worth billions of dollars just because they're entrenched with so many firms. You're obsessed with data: We have a rich dataset that is ripe for automation and AI. With our data advantage, we can provide our users with intelligent automation, predictions of common workflow patterns, and analytics that will fundamentally change the structure of audits. You greatly value culture: Our goals are lofty, we work very hard, and we want to transform an industry. More importantly , we also work responsibly. We place a premium on building a sustainable, inclusive, high EQ, high feedback, and safe company that celebrates individuals of all backgrounds. ‍ Responsibilities: Be an essential technical contributor at a Series B company as it scales. Play a leadership role on the end-to-end development of features, specifically in regards to making architectural decisions and trading off different approaches. Bring a mindset of continuous improvement to your work. You’ll be responsible for making our technology and processes better over time. Understand how to optimize for iteration speed while maintaining a high quality bar and technical rigor. You'll have experience with several of the following: 5+ years of engineering experience Excitement for product-focused application of ML/AI - this will be a production-focused role Exceptional technical proficiency with at least one programming language, particularly Python or TypeScript Understanding of ML concepts like supervised/unsupervised/self-supervised learning, neural networks and deep learning Understanding of modern ML/AI technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs (e.g., GPT-3+, open source models, etc.), RAG architectures, and their applications Experience architecting systems and data pipelines that can handle the ingestion, digitalization, storage, and retrieval of document-heavy data sets, including document processing, search, and classification Experience in developing, testing, evaluating and deploying ML models Ability to collaborate on all aspects of product strategy and UX Experience shaping an early stage tech stack and product, and engineering organization Nice to haves: Experience training, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs Familiarity with ML frameworks and tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn Familiarity with modern web tech stacks consisting of several of the following: TypeScript, React, GraphQL, NodeJS, Hasura, Postgres, Python, and AWS Experience with cloud computing platforms like AWS Experience with DevOps and continuous integration/delivery best practices Compensation Range: $170K - $203K",

        "description": "Here at Spellbrush , we're passionate about making a good anime game. We also happen to be the world's leading generative AI studio — we're the team behind niji・journey . We are currently investigating how AI can be used to help human artists perform masterpieces in the most complex medium of our times: videogames. Our games are characterized by a no-compromise approach to well-balanced gameplay married to a truthful love of visual arts. If you love turn-based tactics games, please consider applying! The Role Spellbrush, the world’s leading generative AI studio behind_ niji・journey __ , _ is looking for an LLM Prompt Engineer to bring the characters and world in our mobile turn-based tactics game to life with distinctive flair! If you love games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics and are eager to utilize Generative AI to create evocative gameplay experiences, please apply! What You’ll Do Become the power user and wizarding wordsmith of our LLM models, coaxing out new turns of phrase, emotional responses, and vivid imagery through imaginative prompt engineering. Deeply understand our next flagship game’s core narrative, themes, and character motivations and conflicts – then translate these elements into elegant LLM prompts. Work with our Creative Director to develop new systems for enabling our game’s characters to freely express themselves in the native game platforms where they interact with players. NOTE: You do not need to be currently involved in LLM research or an AI / ML expert to apply - we highly value your writing and creative ability. You Might Be a Great Fit If You endeavor to use LLM’s to revolutionize character communications. A familiarity with text-based Generative AI and LLM is definitely handy, but moreso than that you understand that LLM’s are working off of datasets and training, and that your finesse in guiding the models will produce outstanding delights of diction. You’re eager to push the boundaries of written and verbal communications. Part of the challenge (and excitement) of using LLM’s is that they can produce combinations of words and phrases to produce meanings, mental images, and interactions never before imagined. Maybe you’ve devised a new alien language for a sci-fi novel or a mana system for an underground race of mushroom people. Whatever it is, going beyond the norm in your creativity will help our LLM models reach their limitless potential. You understand what it means to be human, and how our human tendencies emerge in conversation. To make authentic and genuine conversations, we believe the author (or in this case, prompter), should have a deep familiarity with the nuances that make language feel more “human”. Whatever your mode of introspection and emotional exploration, we’d love to know (and support it)! The anime aesthetic resonates with you. It's no secret – we're huge anime enthusiasts, and our work focuses on the anime aesthetic. Your work will enable characters to partake in the full spectrum of emotions and reactions with unique personality, whether yandere, tsundere, or a new archetype you invent! (This is a check to see if you're reading thoroughly - craft a little \"tweet\" written by an anime character in the Anything Else you'd like us to know\" question!) You're comfortable working on small, fast-paced, on-site teams Working here will feel very much like a small indie studio: close-knit, with high ownership and flexibility. We’re also an in-person studio. Our games team is at our office in downtown San Francisco, CA, 3-4x a week! And you're excited about the potential of Generative AI. You'll also be working closely with some of the best AI researchers in the world. Part of working with our team will involve looking at our latest research results and figuring out how to apply them to the game best. You will be at the cutting edge of what is possible with machine learning, art, and games. The final base salary is dependent upon location, experience, fit, and other factors. In addition, we offer a generous compensation package that includes equity, top-tier employer-sponsored health, dental, and vision insurance, and additional perks! At Spellbrush, we value creativity, collaboration, and innovation. If you're excited about working with cutting-edge technology and passionate about anime, gaming, and generative AI, we’d love to hear from you! To apply - please share your previous work experience/resume, writing portfolio, sample or prompt engineering sample, and the name of the best waifu or husbando in your message!",

        "description": "About The Role Underpinning Character.AI’s trajectory is a sequence of larger, more intelligent, and empathetic models. As these models get larger, it is increasingly important to make rigorous decisions when training and serving them: what architecture/data composition/hyperparameters? How do we optimize the model? How much ROI do we get from human input? This is especially the case when models are so large that we can only train them once. Our team discovers the scientific understanding for building our models. We dig deep into modeling and optimization decisions, and use our empirical knowledge to inform the design and training, leaving no stone unturned in the quest for better and better models. Responsibilities We are looking for candidates with an abiding interest in how large models work, and the technical skills to advance our understanding of them. Especially, we desire candidates with an unusual clarity of thought, and a capacity to think from first principles. We work closely with our data, pre-training, and post-training teams. Here is a list of sample projects: Run thousands of ablation and scaling experiments to understand underlying mechanisms in models. Select model and architecture hyperparameters achieving best-possible tradeoffs in inference latency and model quality. Determine the incremental value of additional human input in post-training. Job Requirements A bachelor's degree in a quantitative field (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science); PhD preferred. 2+ years experience in industry, training, evaluating, and meaningfully modifying models. Working experience with at least one of PyTorch, Jax, or TensorFlow (not just high level APIs like keras.train). An excellent understanding of probability theory, linear algebra, and stochastic processes. A healthy dose of skepticism about experimental results and interpretations, and a deep cynicism about published AI/ML research. Nice to Have (Optional) O(1000) careful ablation experiments under your belt. Papers in Neurips/ICML/ICLR. Specialized knowledge in (stochastic) optimization, condensed matter physics About Character.AI Founded in 2021 by AI pioneers Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, Character is a leading AI company offering personalized experiences through customizable AI 'Characters.' As one of the most widely used AI platforms worldwide, Character enables users to interact with AI tailored to their unique needs and preferences.

Why It’s Exciting Work on one of the most important problems in the field. Digital robots will unlock the next 100x productivity increase, and free humans from trillions of hours of soul-crushing work. Hard, novel problems. Many of the problems we’re solving have never been solved before. They span core infrastructure (we built our own browser), the frontiers of AI/ML, and UX design for entirely new modes of human-computer interaction. Talk to users, ship, repeat. We have a product that is being used in production and has incredible demand. Our approach is to begin with a highly reliable model that solves the most tedious problems today, and then iteratively scale capability and usability to full self-driving. Work with amazing people. We are building a tiny, ambitious team that works shoulder-to-shoulder 6 days / week. We particularly enjoy working with people who are open-minded, broadly curious, and kind. If those sound like good reasons to you too, then here’s a bit about what we are looking for. We Should Talk If You Take pride in your work. You are the kind of person who can’t bring themselves to do bad work, and works hard no matter the project. You care deeply about what you build, and the people you build it for. Have high velocity. You must be able to move very quickly through large codebases with complex, low-level code—while writing good abstractions with sensible tradeoffs. Have built hard things before. Building self-driving for the computer is very hard. If you have a track record of building hard things you are more likely to succeed at this one.",

        "description": "Who We Are Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too. At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 250,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more. Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond. We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors. What We're Looking For Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small. You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell. You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college. Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects. What You'll Do This is a 1 of 1 role as a full stack developer focused on building Roboflow Universe, our open source dataset and model sharing hub, into the pre-eminent computer vision community. We’re looking for a generalist that wants to wear many hats; at times you’ll need to play the role of engineer (~50% of your time/bandwidth), growth (25%), product manager (20%), and community builder (5%). We’re looking for the founder of a future team that will blossom as they grow Universe’s scale and impact. Universe is already the largest and fastest growing collection of open source computer vision datasets and APIs, hosting over 200 million user-labeled images, 200,000 open-source datasets, and 100,000 fine-tuned models for a long-tail of computer vision use-cases. It has thousands of daily users and we are now promoting it to a top-level initiative. No two days will be the same in this role. Some examples of projects you could work on include: - Expanding our semantic search feature to allow searching by uploading an image - Adding achievements and gamification mechanics - Creating new pages for programmatic SEO - Implementing automated categorization and curation functionality - Integrating with new distribution channels - Tying new features of our core platform into Universe - Optimizing conversion funnels - Building APIs to expose additional functionality to users’ applications - Expanding from a read to a read/write paradigm - Showcasing foundation and multimodal models to users Apart from the things you’ll build, you’ll also be doing things like: - Diving into metrics to gain insights into how things tick - Talking to users to better understand what they need - Working with our marketing team to do joint initiatives - Running and iterating on experiments/tests you come up with 📅 Within one week, you will… Learn all about our product, company, customers, and vision. Get ramped up in our codebase & become familiar with our architecture and backend. Ship something substantial to an end user. 📅 Within one month, you will… Onboard in person with our founders at our SF hub. Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already) Be fully ramped up in the codebase & lead your first major initiative. Take over responsibility for the Universe roadmap. 📅 Within three months, you will… Deliver several important new tent-pole features on Roboflow Universe. Be the primary owner of Universe’s metrics. Participate in quarterly planning & chart a course for the next few months. Develop a vision, strategy, and plan for the future of Roboflow Universe. 📅 Within six months, you will… Execute against the goals, roadmap & plans. Attend your first all company onsite. Who You Are The ideal candidate for this role is highly technical, curious, and autonomous. As the founding member of the (future) Universe team you’ll need to chart your own course. This role would be perfect for a former technical founder. To be successful, you’ll need to be a capable full-stack developer versed in web technologies (like JavaScript and HTML/CSS, Node.js, and Python). We use Firebase and ElasticSearch (amongst many other pieces of technology), but you can learn those on the job assuming you have a strong grounding in software development fundamentals. We’d like for you to have experience growing a web-based product organically (bonus points for familiarity with user generated content, creating network effects, & community). Experience in developer tools and the computer vision / machine learning space is a plus. Who You'll Be Working With Our team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ person engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others. You will work directly with our CTO and alongside the rest of our 15-person product/engineering team, with top-notch designers, engineers, and ML experts. Where You'll Work Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best! When You'll Work Roboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you’ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed. What You'll Receive To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market. 💰 The target compensation for this role is $165,000 + equity. 📈 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights: A $4000 Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work with alongside other Roboflowers. A $350 Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high - speed internet at home or a co-working space. Coverage of up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family. Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision and Roboflow.

        "description": "At Kyber, we’re building a next generation document generation and delivery platform for the enterprise . While building Generative AI solutions for the insurance industry, we realized that today’s claims teams are spending 30-40% of their time just drafting tedious, hard to understand regulatory notices for claimants and third parties. As we dug deeper, we realized that the reason for this largely fell on outdated enterprise tools that were holding them back. Document generation tools are a critical yet often overlooked aspect of operations and poor systems can severely impact efficiency not just in insurance but across multiple industries. We believe our platform will fundamentally change how organizations interact with and leverage their information, unlocking new possibilities for innovation and growth by keeping their people focused on what matters in their business. Just a Few Of The Cutting-edge Platform Features That Allow Us To Enable a 10x Boost In Productivity For Enterprises Include Generative AI powered smart drafting that automatically leverages existing unstructured context to get writers to the best possible first draft.

The amount of data within companies is growing exponentially and is increasingly more siloed with the proliferation of vertical specific SAAS applications and unique client formats. Lume solves this problem by leveraging AI to act as a translation layer to enable your data to flow between systems seamlessly. You give us your desired schema, and we do the rest from mapping, classifying, aggregating, and other data transformation tasks to fit your incoming data. We have developed novel strategies leveraging LLMs that stemmed from our NLP research during our graduate degrees at Stanford University. We have raised over $4M to date from the top firms in the valley such as Khosla Ventures (OpenAI, Replit) and General Catalyst (Stripe, Airbnb) along with other notable angels. Today, we’re growing and excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. About The Role Fully automating data transformation and data modeling has been an unsolved problem in technology since the invention of the database; therefore, it is technically challenging. It requires a deep understanding of both scalable data infrastructure and cutting-edge AI models. We are looking for curious, independent thinkers that are willing to join us to tackle these challenges to empower the industry. In This Role, You Will Innovate on the cutting-edge of AI by conducting research, applying the latest advancements in the generative AI field, and architecting new approaches. Build and maintain, durable, scalable infrastructure capable of processing Gigabytes/sec particularly related to calls to LLMs and the reliability of the output.

Work alongside the founders to develop automated data integration technology, shape product direction, have direct relationships with customers, and help build out our team. In This Role, You Will Thrive If You Have experience building and deploying LLMs into a production environment and are familiar with the advantages of the technology and its limitations. You also have experience in prompt engineering and stay informed about the latest advancements in LLMs. Can identify the most important problems, intuit whether off-the-shelf or in-house solutions are needed, learn the knowledge gaps you are missing for the problem, and stay scrappy to execute the task until it is solved without explicit direction. Feel comfortable sharing feedback early and often, as well as receive feedback. Have at least 3 years of professional ML or Data Infrastructure experience. Location We are located in Manhattan, NY, working in person 5 days a week. Benefits And Perks Generous Compensation: At Lume, we only hire those that are the best at what they do.

        "description": "About GiveDirectly GiveDirectly (GD) provides cash grants directly to people living in extreme poverty. Since launching in 2011, GD has raised over $1B, delivered cash to more than 1.5 million recipients, launched operations in 15 countries, and continues to expand its reach across the Global South. GD has also grown the research base supporting unconditional cash with 20 randomized control trials from its programs, generating rigorous evidence across countries and contexts. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) has been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist. Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and agile. We work alongside 750+ individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. Team members at GiveDirectly attest that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not just buzzwords, but a fundamental part of our culture and values. We actively seek to recruit individuals from the communities we serve, and use DEI as a lens in our hiring practices, programs, and initiatives. Our goal is to maintain a workplace where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work, and feel valued and respected for who they are. We strive to be inclusive of all cultures and experiences while upholding our values globally. In the spirit of our \"Know Yourself and Grow\" value, we recognize there is always room to improve our team's working experience. But day to day, we aim to \"Create Positive Energy\" - we take care of one another, have fun, aim to maximize flexibility and accessibility in roles, and pursue professional development opportunities to stay challenged & engaged in our work. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other status protected by law. Location: This role is fully remote but must overlap with an East Africa timezone by at least 4 hours. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visas in the U.S. or U.K. at this time. About This Role The mission of the Central Data team is to empower GiveDirectly with a rigorous, data-driven culture to maximize our efficiency, effectiveness, and scale of delivering dollars to recipients. Access to accurate, timely, actionable financial data is key to this mission but currently a pain point for the organization. As the seventh member of Central Data, you will collaborate with the Finance team to build, maintain, and improve data pipelines, tools, and dashboards to address this need. Additionally, you will work closely with the Senior Data Architect to maintain and enhance our current infrastructure (AWS, Databricks, Tableau) to ensure data accessibility for data scientists and analysts. Reports to: Graham Tyler (Director of Data) Level : Manager Travel Requirement: Must be able to travel ~1-2 times per year to one of our countries of operation for team retreats or field visits What You’ll Do Success in this role is determined by meeting these key objectives: [30%] Build data pipelines and tools that reduce the time and risk associated with monthly financial reporting and other finance processes. Reconciling data across accounts and systems is currently a time consuming, mostly manual process. You will combine data from multiple sources in Databricks and automate reconciliation tasks. [20%] Build datasets and dashboards that make financial data more transparent, actionable, and accurate. Only top level financial metrics are currently available in dashboards. You will make detailed financial data easily accessible for decisions and analysis, as well as automate data quality tests to validate key financial metrics. [20%] Increase data available for analysis and ML models by ingesting new data sources. Our data lakehouse does not currently include data from all internal data sources, such as our HR system. You will build pipelines to make this data available and useful. [30%] Increase speed of development, reduce infrastructure failures and cost. On-call rotation duties: monitor pipeline jobs, review and test new pipeline PRs, track usage and cost. Add new data quality checks and alerting. Proactively identify and implement improvements to data infrastructure, as well as the tools used by data scientists and analysts to develop, deploy, and share their work. Leave our systems and processes better than you found them. What You’ll Bring Exceptional alignment with GiveDirectly Values and active demonstration of our core competencies: emotional intelligence, problem solving, project management, follow-through, and fostering inclusivity. We welcome and strongly encourage applications from candidates who have personal or professional experience in the low-income and/or historically marginalized communities that we serve. Language Requirement: English Language Preferences: No additional language preferences Critical thinking and analytical approach necessary to develop technical solutions that scale and are resilient to changes over time Entrepreneurial mindset and stakeholder management skills required to identify, design, and execute technical solutions that solve important, ambiguous organizational problems Python, SQL, and spark expertise, along with core competencies required to ship high quality data pipelines and data tools fast Extensive experience with Databricks preferred; experience with Tableau is a plus Intellectual humility, curiosity, and a commitment to being part of an exceptional team Compensation At GiveDirectly, we strive to pay our employees generously and equitably.

GD has also grown the research base supporting unconditional cash with 20 randomized control trials from its programs, generating rigorous evidence across countries and contexts. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) has been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist. Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and agile. We work alongside 750+ individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. Team members at GiveDirectly attest that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not just buzzwords, but a fundamental part of our culture and values. We actively seek to recruit individuals from the communities we serve, and use DEI as a lens in our hiring practices, programs, and initiatives. Our goal is to maintain a workplace where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work, and feel valued and respected for who they are. We strive to be inclusive of all cultures and experiences while upholding our values globally. In the spirit of our \"Know Yourself and Grow\" value, we recognize there is always room to improve our team's working experience. But day to day, we aim to \"Create Positive Energy\" - we take care of one another, have fun, aim to maximize flexibility and accessibility in roles, and pursue professional development opportunities to stay challenged & engaged in our work. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other status protected by law. Location: This role is fully remote but must overlap with an East Africa timezone by at least 4 hours. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visas in the U.S. or U.K. at this time. About This Role The mission of the Central Data team is to empower GiveDirectly with a rigorous, data-driven culture to maximize our efficiency, effectiveness, and scale of delivering dollars to recipients. Building datasets that help us fully understand our donors, improve fundraising interventions, and ultimately raise more money is key to this mission. However, we currently lack many necessary datasets because we do not have pipelines to extract data from key fundraising platforms or combine data across platforms. We have been awarded a $100,000 grant to fund a contractor role that will work full-time (40 hours / week) within Central Data for around one year to address these needs. You will work closely with the Senior Data Architect who oversees our infrastructure (AWS, Databricks, Tableau) and data pipeline development; the Fundraising Data Manager who will turn these datasets into dashboards and insights; and fundraising stakeholders who will use these insights to raise more money for recipients. Reports to: Graham Tyler (Director of Data) Level : Manager Travel Requirement: There are no travel requirements for this role. What You’ll Do Success in this role is determined by meeting these key objectives: [20%] Ingest all relevant data sources into our data lakehouse (AWS, Databricks). We have existing pipelines, metrics, and dashboards leveraging data from our donor CRM and email provider. You will build new pipelines and jobs to ingest data from our website analytics platform and donor ticketing system. [40%] Build unified datasets to fully understand donors and fundraising interventions. Once all data sources are in Databricks, you will work with stakeholders to define metrics, facts, and dimensions necessary for new dashboards, analysis, ML models, and experimentation that will drive fundraising strategy. Then you will build pipelines to clean, transform, and combine data from all platforms into these actionable datasets. [30%] Reduce data quality incidents with automated data quality tests and monitoring. Implement data quality tests and alerting for key donation, donor, and donor engagement variables. Monitor job and pipeline performance. Proactively identify and implement improvements to our existing pipelines. [10%] Make it easy to maintain your pipelines and tools. Create comprehensive, easy to understand documentation to ensure effective knowledge transfer of your work. Build within our existing configurable pipeline framework and identify ways to improve this process. Leave our systems and processes better than you found them. What You’ll Bring Exceptional alignment with GiveDirectly Values and active demonstration of our core competencies: emotional intelligence, problem solving, project management, follow-through, and fostering inclusivity. We welcome and strongly encourage applications from candidates who have personal or professional experience in the low-income and/or historically marginalized communities that we serve.

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large, impactful engineering projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the ‘why’ behind what you are doing. You understand engineering fundamentals. On our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) do not work. You can work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

Plus much more! Life at Abridge At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate. Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful. Diversity & Inclusion Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Citizen provides 911 alerts so people can use their phones to keep themselves, and the people and places they love, safe. Citizen has notified people to evacuate burning buildings, deterred school buses from nearby terrorist attacks, and led to the rescue of kidnapped children and missing people. Citizen's 911 alerts are accompanied by live stories, real-time updates, and user-generated content so app users never have to wonder why there are helicopters overhead or fire engines flying by. By broadcasting from the scene of an incident, communicating with one another, and reading live updates, communities are empowered by Citizen. We act fast, break news, and give people the immediate information they need to stay safe. And we're just getting started. Our flagship paid product—Citizen Premium—is a only-of-its-kind personal safety subscription that allows users to reach a digital guardian 24/7 for $20/mo. Subscribers used Citizen Premium to guide emergency response to remote hiking locations, or travel safely on late-night walks. Citizen Plus, which sits between the free Citizen app and Citizen Premium at $6/mo, currently unlocks 6 new features. Available for the first time ever, Citizen Plus includes the powerful ability to listen to police and fire radios, customize your alerts, unlock past incidents, create alert zones, view nearby registered offenders, and see crime statistics.

Our Challenges Scaling & Bursting: With thousands of users joining the platform each day, we need to ensure our systems scale to handle expanded load gracefully. On significant events, we see over a million simultaneously connected clients and their associated live streams. Our core systems need to be able to efficiently support these traffic patterns and continue to scale to millions of more users in the future. Machine learning: We process thousands of hours of audio every day looking for incidents that impact our users' safety. To do this at scale, we've built ML models for audio analysis and targeting using the current state of the art from academia. Analytics: We want to alert users to the incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics. Mobile video streaming: Our app ingests high-quality video at low-latency, transcodes, and redistributes the video to external media outlets seamlessly. Radio hardware: We build our own software-defined radio-based devices to consume all radio dispatch in every major city, whether analog or digital.

        "description": "About Orita Direct-to-consumer brands pay us, in order to market less. Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less. How? We use a lot of math and a lot of machine learning to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now. When you do this, two things happen. Brands save a ton of money. And their deliverability improves, which means they make more money because their emails land in inboxes, not in spam. Cool. Fewer messages sent + higher chance they will be seen = ROI goes way up. Sounds simple, right? Well, it’s not. You try getting marketers to be less market-y. It’s way easier to “play it safe” and email everyone all the time. Our math has to be that good. But you said there would be math. Yes. We said there would be math. And that’s where you come in. We need people with amazing neural networks in their heads to help our artificial ones do their thing. You’ll be one of the founding members of our engineering team.
