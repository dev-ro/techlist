        "description": "This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels. We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon. Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices. These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware. But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices. We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments.

Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer. Most product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison. We also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu. As the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence. These roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community. Location: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone. What you'll do Security roles might tackle any of the following: Define, implement and document new security features Lead security-oriented thinking in a product engineering team Analyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software Contribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community Audit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities Integrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes Achieve and retain various security certifications Extend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification Work with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks Design and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu Monitor the security industry for new developments Develop, test and maintain new software capabilities Provide guidance and support to other engineering teams What we are looking for in you An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations A thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities Modern engineering techniques to find and fix them Familiarity with open source development tools and methodologies Skill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP Experience as a security champion Experience driving security within a wider SDLC process Professional written and spoken English Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation Excellent communication and presentation skills Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each Optional skills we also value Clear and effective communication with the team and Ubuntu community members Experience working with Linux Kernel Security Certification experience and knowledge in FIPS and/or CC Experience with OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language) Knowledge of and familiarity with low-level Linux cryptography APIs Demonstrated high learning ability Performance engineering experience What we offer you We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

        "description": "About Us Amper is a rapidly-growing IoT startup that helps manufacturers unleash their potential with modern software to run operations. We build a simple but powerful platform that helps manufacturers reduce costs, increase visibility, and drive efficiency. We believe in keeping things simple and easy-to-understand - and our culture and products are a reflection of that. For example, it takes a few minutes to self-install Amper on any kind of industrial machine - like a consumer device and without the traditional hassle of integration. Our vision is to build the market-leading FactoryOS to enable cutting-edge operations, and we are investing in the next level of growth across our GTM and product teams. We are a venture-backed startup with a distributed team and HQ in Chicago. About You We’re growing our engineering team and we’re looking for senior full-stack engineers to continue building our customer-facing and internal products. Working as a full-stack engineer at Amper means working in a wide variety of contexts. We build large APIs as well as microservices. We write a lot of Python. Our front ends are largely React alongside some third party tools. We need to build for the web and for mobile.

        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The Batch Compute team at Stripe manages the infrastructure, tooling and systems behind running batch processing systems at Stripe, which are currently powered by Hadoop and Spark. Batch processing systems power several core asynchronous workflows at Stripe and operate at significant scale. What you’ll do We're looking for a Software Engineer with experience designing, building and maintaining high-scale, distributed systems. You will work with a team that is in charge of the core infrastructure used by the product teams to build and operate batch processing jobs. You will have an opportunity to play a hands-on role in significantly rearchitecting our current infrastructure to be much more efficient and resilient. This re-architecture will introduce disaggregation of Hadoop storage and compute with open source solutions. Responsibilities Scope, design, implement, and deploy robust solutions, making appropriate tradeoffs between reliability, throughput, latency, resiliency, engineering velocity and cost Innovate, design and implement software solutions that contribute towards improvement in resiliency, reliability, efficiency and management at scale for batch processing infrastructure Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements 8+ years of professional hands-on software development experience Proven track record of building large scale, complex distributed systems; identifying shortcomings and optimization opportunities; and making data driven cost performance tradeoffs to influence design decisions Experience building and operating infrastructure and tools that empower developers/product teams to deliver business value Experience in operational maintenance of large scale distributed systems Preferred Qualifications Track record of open source contributions to data processing or big data systems (Hadoop, Spark, Celeborn, Flink, etc) Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $209,800 - $314,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

        "description": "Grow as an engineer by building tools that grow local businesses You became an engineer because you believed in technology’s ability to make a difference in the world. So why would you spend your days building things that don’t matter? Groupon is an experiences marketplace that brings people more ways to get the most out of their city or wherever they may be. By enabling real-time mobile commerce across local businesses, live events and travel destinations, Groupon helps people find and discover experiences––big and small, new and familiar––that make for a full, fun and rewarding life. Groupon helps local businesses grow and strengthen customer relationships––resulting in strong, vibrant communities. Even with thousands of employees spread across multiple continents, we still maintain a culture that inspires innovation, rewards risk-taking and celebrates success. As a Cloud Engineer on our Cloud Platform team, you will grow your career by working for an international, multicultural company with thousands of employees that runs on a Service-oriented architecture (SOA) with 300 microservices and millions of concurrent clients. You should be fascinated about performance, capacity, and stability, and be passionate about the quality of code and test coverage, as those things are critical to the success of our system. In this role, you will help drive innovation within the team bringing your knowledge and expertise in routing and CDNs. You will contribute to critically assessing and improving current designs and configurations, ensuring that the company’s cloud infrastructure remains at the cutting edge of technology and best practices. You will work with application owners to understand their needs and define requirements for their operation in the cloud platform. This role involves working with cutting-edge technology and solving challenging technical problems. The platform capabilities we are building will be used by every engineering team at Groupon, and this is your chance to influence how microservices are developed and deployed on a company-wide scale. We're a \"best of both worlds\" kind of company. We're big enough to have resources and scale, but small enough that a single person has a surprising amount of autonomy and can make a meaningful impact. We're curious, fun, a little intense, and kind of obsessed with helping local businesses thrive. Key Responsibilities: Cloud Infrastructure Design and Management: Design, implement, and manage cloud infrastructure solutions on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Optimize cloud resources for cost, performance, and reliability. Networking and Routing: Develop and maintain robust networking solutions, including VPCs, subnets, routing tables, and gateways.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Deploy and manage CDNs to improve content delivery speed and reliability. Configure CDN settings for optimal performance and security. Monitor CDN performance and troubleshoot issues as they arise. Caching Solutions: Implement and manage caching strategies to enhance application performance. Utilize caching technologies such as Redis, Memcached, or CloudFront. Monitor cache performance and optimize configurations as needed. Service Mesh and Envoy Proxy: Design and deploy service mesh architectures to manage microservices using tools such as Istio or Linkerd. Implement and manage Envoy proxy for service discovery, load balancing, traffic management, and observability. Configure Envoy to ensure security, reliability, and performance within the service mesh. Monitor and troubleshoot Envoy proxy issues and optimize its configurations. Security: Implement robust security measures to protect cloud infrastructure and data. Configure and manage IAM roles, security groups, and firewall rules. Conduct regular security assessments and audits, and remediate vulnerabilities. Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations. Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Set up and maintain monitoring tools to track the health and performance of cloud services. Troubleshoot and resolve issues related to cloud infrastructure, networking, CDNs, caching, and Envoy proxy. Develop and implement disaster recovery plans. Collaboration and Documentation: Work closely with development, operations, and security teams to ensure seamless integration and deployment of cloud services. Create and maintain comprehensive documentation for cloud infrastructure, configurations, and procedures. Provide training and support to team members as needed. Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or related field, or equivalent experience. Minimum of 5 years of experience in cloud engineering or a related role. Proficiency in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Strong knowledge of networking principles, including TCP/IP, DNS, and routing protocols. Experience with CDNs, caching technologies, and service mesh architectures. Hands-on experience with Envoy proxy and its configuration and management. Solid understanding of cloud security principles and best practices. Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation. Proficiency in scripting languages such as Python, Bash, or PowerShell. Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work under pressure. Strong communication and collaboration skills. Preferred Qualifications: Relevant cloud certifications (e.g., AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Azure Solutions Architect Expert, Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect). Experience with Kubernetes and container orchestration. Familiarity with DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines. What We Offer: Competitive salary and benefits package. Opportunity to work with a talented and passionate team. Continuous learning and professional development opportunities. Flexible work environment with remote work options.

        "created_on": 1720634881.3225632,
        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The Stripe Dashboard is the primary way that merchants manage their Stripe accounts with a web browser. The Dashboard Foundation team is building the backend and frontend platform that powers many parts of the Dashboard. Not only does the team drive new capabilities for merchants, but it also works closely with many internal teams and organizations to make their features possible. The team is composed of frontend engineers, backend engineers, and designers, and often works with data scientists, technical program managers, and others. We’re a mix of remote and on-site, and distributed throughout North America. We’re looking for a staff frontend engineer who is passionate about building and enabling user-facing experiences that span both the frontend platform and UI to solve critical business problems for Stripe Merchants. What you’ll do As a leader on the Dashboard Foundation team, you will help shape the team’s vision and roadmap, guide and mentor your peers, and lead by example. Because the Dashboard is a very large product with many stakeholders and moving parts, you will work with many product teams to understand their short- and long-term goals, identify critical and opportunistic projects, and plan accordingly. As an engineer on the team, you’ll build platform-level capabilities for the Dashboard’s frontend, elevating the experience for every merchant. By creating and expanding these platform capabilities, you’ll make the experience in the Dashboard support the ever-changing needs of merchants for years to come. And you’ll accelerate other teams at Stripe by enabling them to focus on their unique goals without needing to think about platform-level concerns. Responsibilities Build frontend platform capabilities that impact millions of users, regardless of whether they’re a merchant or fellow employee Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation Drive sound technical decision-making and lead technical conversations with other teams across Stripe Shape your team’s culture, roadmap, and vision through your guidance, mentorship, foresight, and technical and social expertise. As a leader within Engineering, assist with growth and development of your team and organization while maintaining a high bar for excellence and technical curiosity Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements Experience as a technical lead by guiding your team, influencing its roadmap, and overseeing complex projects spanning multiple teams Experience building a frontend platform (I.E. the “back of the frontend”) that solves broad problems for other teams Mastery of TypeScript and React Thrive in a collaborative environment with other teams to identify high-impact ways of solving problems quickly Excellent oral and written communication 5+ years of frontend engineering experience building end-to-end user solutions Preferred Qualifications 8+ years of experience in full-time software development roles You strive for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have a good intuition for what will last and scale well Experience building scalable, resilient, and observable systems while understanding UX best practices for the frontend You can put yourself in the shoes of your users to understand their needs and fit that into the bigger picture You stitch together many different services and processes, even if you have not worked with them before Experience with building software for fellow developers Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $209,800 - $314,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, TypeScript, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too!
