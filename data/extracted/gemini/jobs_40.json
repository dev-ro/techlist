        "description": "A little about us: The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed. Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you. A day in the life: In this role, you will provide support and related services to the implementation of enterprise data representations in various mission domains. You will be performing end-to-end systems engineering for data flows from the perspective of data format modeling, data mapping, and support to implementers and mission customers. This role requires strong software and systems engineering expertise from cradle to grave with limited, high-level direction, in the areas of: Enabling and growing existing automation efforts, adding additional data streams, and driving forward data transformation efforts. Focusing on the sponsor’s business analytics, metrics collection, and analysis efforts. The sponsor’s management team requires a data scientist to characterize the sponsor’s workforce, workforce productivity and output, and the value of collection to the workforce. Possessing an instinctive aptitude to leverage information and knowledge sharing networks and navigate conflict in a way that fosters constructive outcomes. What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. All of our data scientists need the following skills: Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list. A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects. For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects. For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. For this particular role, you will also need: A broad range of knowledge including information technology, requirements, technical architecture analysis (e.g., understanding data flow diagrams, system architecture diagrams, etc.), and an understanding of functional and system analysis. Knowledge of multiple development methodologies, Agile (Scrum & Kanban), etc. An understanding of SIGINT These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory: Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding) Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React Why Red Alpha? Every day, our elite customers are pushing through \"the grind\" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom.

The successful candidate will have a passion for business impact. Technically, they will be involved in the full modeling lifecycle, from building data models and pipelines, developing models, implementing metrics, and performing residual analysis to guide model improvements. They will join a high performing technical team focused on delivering high impact work, with team-wide best practices (e.g. clean code, reproducible/transferrable work, git, etc.) and effective levels of communication. ﻿Responsibilities Create data pipelines as needed Combine machine learning, heuristics, and business rules to build models that solve business problems Write code for reproducible and reusable model metric measures Perform exploratory data analysis (eda) and residual analysis to identify areas of improvement for modeling efforts Qualifications Experience building models that solve business problems Experience independently answering business and related analytics questions with interpretable and direct quantitative approaches. Experience in using Python for analysis, including the use of common libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), creating and sharing jupyter notebooks, and building reusable functions and scripts. Fluency in using SQL for common data access, transformations, and aggregations. Ph.D. or M.S. in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, Operations Research, or related scientific discipline. Focus will be on seed placement domain - Bridging the gap between research team and product development team for Seed Placement / Recommendations. What exactly does this mean? Corteva is working towards identifying the best seed for a particular soil type and growing region, that then will produce the best yield - ultimately creating a win-win for both Corteva and the farmers that purchase this seed. In the future, they will also work at identifying the best crop protection products that are best suited for the seed & soil type. Be the bridge between teams (Research teams who are rich in domain knowledge, less tech/data science; & Direct Business Product facing – Product Dev (PD)) and help to build recommendations in product experience systems / model on Applied Data Science team to improve predictions. This is NOT new, novel research. Rather improvement in existing models. MUST have strong communication and ability to translate technical components into non-technical terms. Ability to tell a story about what's happening with a data model, why, and ability to reinforce the decision or pivot. This leader will look for strength + passion in problem solving, finding an answer using a toolkit/statistical tools; problem solver and guiding solutioning for next model. For example, if they find Model X is not right for a group of users, investigate another solution - where is it not perfect, be able to tell the story why; SME - Hypothesis forming. Does not need to have Ag experience. Always helpful, but not necessary to be considered. PHD is not required – MS is fine. MUST have 2+ years of work experience Self-starter confidence – reach out for help when needed but be able to work independently MUST be strong in SQL, Python, Pandas, and strong clean coding practices - checking for errors, duplicates, 1:many ratios, etc. Ideally they have some stats background NOT looking for someone who just wants to run and tune data models - this role will be full stack, finding data sources, normalizing, running analysis on the model and telling a story about it. May partner with someone else on the team too.",

        "description": "Our Company Miso Robotics is transforming the food industry, and making lives better. We've developed an AI-powered kitchen robot named Flippy which automates the most repetitive of kitchen tasks, such as operating a deep fryer. Flippy is fun to watch, but under the hood, he’s powered by a sophisticated AI platform – all driven by our proprietary deep learning experience and patented technologies Miso is a well known first-mover in kitchen automation, AI, and robotics. The company has raised over $100 million from crowdfunding, which we believe makes it THE most successful crowdfunding story in history. It has successfully piloted its products with the most prominent global brands in food, and now it’s time for the company to partner with institutional capital and super-charge the commercialization of what we do.

        "description": "The world will be unrecognisable in 5 years. Machine learning models are driving our cars, testing our eyesight, detecting our cancer, giving sight to the blind, giving speech to the mute, and dictating what we consume, enjoy, and think. These AI systems are already an integral part of our lives and will shape our future as a species. Soon, we'll conjure unlimited content: from never-ending TV series (where we’re the main character) to personalised tutors that are infinitely patient and leave no student behind. We’ll augment our memories with foundation models—individually tailored to us through RLHF and connected directly to our thoughts via Brain-Machine Interfaces—blurring the lines between organic and machine intelligence and ushering in the next generation of human development. This future demands immense, globally accessible, uncensorable, computational power. Gensyn is the machine learning compute protocol that translates machine learning compute into an always-on commodity resource—outside of centralised control and as ubiquitous as electricity—accelerating AI progress and ensuring that this revolutionary technology is accessible to all of humanity through a free market. Our Principles: AUTONOMY Don’t ask for permission - we have a constraint culture, not a permission culture. Claim ownership of any work stream and set its goals/deadlines, rather than waiting to be assigned work or relying on job specs. Push & pull context on your work rather than waiting for information from others and assuming people know what you’re doing. No middle managers - we don’t (and will likely never) have middle managers. FOCUS Small team - misalignment and politics scale super-linearly with team size. Small protocol teams rival much larger traditional teams. Thin protocol - build and design thinly. Reject waste - guard the company’s time, rather than wasting it in meetings without clear purpose/focus, or bikeshedding . REJECT MEDIOCRITY Give direct feedback to everyone immediately rather than avoiding unpopularity, expecting things to improve naturally, or trading short-term pain for extreme long-term pain. Embrace an extreme learning rate rather than assuming limits to your ability/knowledge. Drive - push areas of ownership to final outcome, despite any barriers. Responsibilities: Train highly distributed models over uniquely decentralised and heterogeneous infrastructure. Partner with both researchers and production engineers to design and run novel experiments, taking research from theory all the way to production. Own and maintain the experimental frameworks and test benches for ML research. Engineering support - work with the engineering team on wider issues concerning ML (e.g. reproducible training). Follow best practices - build in the open with a keen focus on designing, testing, and documenting your code. Publish & collaborate - write research papers targeting top-tier AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, and IJCAI and collaborate with experts from universities and research institutes Minimum requirements: Strong background in applied machine learning. Hands-on experience with distributed model training. Experience building highly performant, distributed systems. Comfortable working in an applied research environment - with extremely high autonomy and unpredictable timelines. Highly self-motivated with excellent verbal and written communication skills. Nice to haves: Experience training highly distributed models. Compensation / Benefits: Competitive salary + share of equity and token pool Fully remote work - we hire between the West Coast (PT) and Central Europe (CET) time zones Relocation Assistance - available for those that would like to relocate after being hired (anywhere from PST through CET time zones) 4x all expenses paid company retreats around the world, per year Whatever equipment you need Paid sick leave Private health, vision, and dental insurance - including spouse/dependents [🇺🇸 only]",

        "description": "About Arc Institute The Arc Institute is a new scientific institution that conducts curiosity-driven basic science and technology development to understand and treat complex human diseases. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Arc is an independent research organization founded on the belief that many important research programs will be enabled by new institutional models. Arc operates in partnership with Stanford University, UCSF, and UC Berkeley. While the prevailing university research model has yielded many tremendous successes, we believe in the importance of institutional experimentation as a way to make progress. These include: Funding: Arc will fully fund Core Investigators’ (PIs’) research groups, liberating scientists from the typical constraints of project-based external grants. Technology: Biomedical research has become increasingly dependent on complex tooling. Arc Technology Centers develop, optimize and deploy rapidly advancing experimental and computational technologies in collaboration with Core Investigators. Support: Arc aims to provide first-class support—operationally, financially and scientifically—that will enable scientists to pursue long-term high risk, high reward research that can meaningfully advance progress in disease cures, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and immune dysfunction. Culture: We believe that culture matters enormously in science and that excellence is difficult to sustain.

We’re building a practical neural interface drawing on the rich neuromotor signals that can be measured non-invasively with single motor neuron resolution. This technology will become one of the main pillars for interaction with the virtual and augmented world.We are a multi-disciplinary team of researchers investigating the nature of human neuromotor signals (i.e., electromyography or EMG), developing novel signal processing and machine learning methods to infer a user’s intent, and creating novel interaction techniques and user experiences. Help us unleash human potential by removing the bottlenecks between user intent and action.EMG signals are similar in many ways to other neural signals and audio signals and can be analyzed using many of the same approaches. For example, the task of transcribing characters typed on a keyboard from wrist-based EMG is closely analogous to that of automatic speech recognition. We’re looking for people who want to shape the future of this technology and explore this exciting new territory with us.
