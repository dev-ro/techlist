        "description": "Organization Overview America Votes works with over 400 state and national partner organizations to advance progressive policies, win elections, and protect every American's right to vote. Since 2003, America Votes has been the common link between many of the largest and most influential issue and membership organizations in the country, serving as the coordination hub of the progressive community. America Votes' work has brought together a wide range of causes and built a unified coalition that has transformed how the progressive community works. Together, they have engaged communities across the country to take action on critical issues - from fighting for working families, defending reproductive rights, protecting the environment, and more - and mobilized millions of voters. America Votes works year-round nationally and in more than 20 states, acting as a permanent campaign to continually advance progressive causes, modernize elections, and win elections. America Votes provides a range of services to partners, including strategic planning, advocacy and electoral campaign coordination, data tools and targeting services, and on-the-ground leadership in key states. America Votes also works to improve election systems and fight back against efforts to suppress voters, taking the lead throughout their state network to coordinate and execute advocacy campaigns with allies to reform elections and modernize the voting process. Racial Equity Statement As a leader of collaborative efforts to mobilize voters, protect voting rights, and win elections, America Votes is committed to advancing racial equity within our organization and across our coalition. We acknowledge the systematic racism that permeates all facets of our society, beginning with the foundational right to vote. America Votes is also engaging with an understanding of the ways gender, sexuality and other forms of oppression intersect with race and how those relationships impact inequities faced by our staff, our partners, and the communities that we engage in our work. America Votes strives to model our commitment to racial equity through our internal and external operations, programs, and partnerships. We acknowledge the inequitable structures that continue to exist and are moving forward with a sustained commitment in time, resources and people to challenge structural racism and work towards creating a reflective organization and democracy. Position Description America Votes is looking for a Senior Data Analyst to join our Analytics team for the 2024 cycle. The ideal candidate has prior experience as a data analyst in an electoral context, a strong foundation in analytics methods, and a vision for how we can use data to answer key questions around targeting and resource allocation such as: How can we leverage our field data and other resources to improve candidate models? What's the best way for partners to use race and ethnicity models for voter targeting? How should we prioritize field operations across our competitive Congressional races? Our analytics team already includes a Data Analyst, who focuses on data visualization and voter contact reporting, and an Analytics Engineer, who transforms our voter contact and voter file data into base tables using dbt. For the Senior Data Analyst role, we're looking for a teammate who can level up our methods, work with other staff to understand the big strategic questions AV has, and bring data to bear on answering those questions in a way that can guide our program choices. This is a cycle position that reports to the Analytics Director and lasts through December 31, 2024. Responsibilities Conduct analyses, lift up insights, and create data products that inform AV's electoral strategies and help build strategy alignment across the progressive coalition. Proactively look for ways we can use our data to inform strategy and support staff. Evaluate and produce guidance about the predictive models we use in our voter contact work. This could look like adjusting or combining existing models, assessing the race equity impact of new models, and creating suggested cut points for targeting. Stay up to date with research and best practices from across the political data space, continually grow your own analytics knowledge, and pitch in to pair program or write code for other data projects that could benefit from more advanced methods. Qualifications Must Haves Strong SQL skills - you should have worked in a data warehouse environment before and be comfortable writing complex queries with joins and aggregate functions. Strong R or Python skills for data analysis - you should be comfortable cleaning messy data, running regressions, and creating simple visuals. Solid understanding of statistics and basic modeling techniques; demonstrated experience using these methods to glean actionable insights from data. Previous experience working on a political campaign or at a progressive organization, including experience working with voter file data and candidate or issue support models. A service oriented approach to data work that prioritizes collaboration, supporting staff and partners, and building for the long term. Nice to Haves Deeper experience with statistics or machine learning for predictive modeling, especially if you've built turnout or support models before. Experience working with geospatial data using spatial SQL, R, or Python, especially if you've worked with spatial clustering algorithms. Experience working with other politically relevant datasets, such as polling, Census, or FEC donor data. Hiring Process Hiring Manager Resume Review Initial Hiring Manager Interview (20 min) Technical Assessment (done on own time, asked to limit to 4 hours) Final Interview (45 minutes) Reference Check Location This position is remote.

        "created_on": 1720631202.3597245,
        "description": "Who we are: At the nonprofit Urban Institute, we believe in the power of evidence to improve lives and strengthen communities. Our employees are empowered to open minds, shape decisions and offer solutions. We encourage intellectual honesty, innovation, diversity, and mutual respect, and our analysis elevates the debate, wherever it takes place. Urban’s greatest asset is our people. We strive to attract and cultivate a vibrant, creative, and diverse community. Our employees drive Urban’s mission through entrepreneurship, innovation, leadership, effective communication, results-orientation, and relationship cultivation. Our success depends on engaging individuals who possess and value these attributes. The Center on Education Data and Policy (EDP) undertakes policy-relevant research on issues from prekindergarten through postsecondary education and creates tools such as Urban’s Education Data Portal. We believe that education policy informed by hard data and rigorous research rather than personal experience and ideology is crucial to realizing the education system’s potential to increase socioeconomic mobility and address growing inequality. A core part of EDP’s strategy is democratizing data for a range of stakeholders working to improve outcomes for students. The Education Data Portal, built in collaboration with Urban’s data science and communications teams, brings all major national datasets on schools, districts, and colleges under one roof, standardizing the information so it is easy to access data, measure change over time, and make connections across datasets. How you’ll contribute: The Center on Education Data and Policy is seeking an experienced data analyst to work on the Education Data Portal and other projects that involve complex data manipulation and management. The successful candidate will spend most of his or her time organizing and cleaning education datasets for inclusion in the Education Data Portal, including the following types of tasks: Standardize variable definitions to create panel datasets on schools, school districts, and colleges. Manipulate data into the format required by the Portal. Write computer programs to efficiently clean and update education datasets. Review data and code for accuracy. Write documentation and create metadata for education datasets. Collaborate with Urban’s Technology & Data Science and Communications teams to ensure that data and metadata are accurately uploaded to the Portal. Help manage the data update process and provide input on the future direction of the Portal, including the development of new tools. Serve as a resource to other staff on education data sources and programming questions. The successful candidate will also contribute to data cleaning and data analysis tasks on other education policy research projects, such as preparing complex student-level datasets for analysis, conducting analyses, and reporting on findings. Data analysis and reporting may be a component of some projects, but this role is focused on understanding, manipulating, and managing education datasets. What you’ll bring: We are looking for an experienced data analyst who is passionate about working with education data. The successful candidate will have: Completed a master’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g. economics, statistics, computer science, data science, or any quantitative social science) or have an equivalent level of experience and education (e.g., a bachelor’s degree with at least two years of experience working with data). Experience working with complex databases, including programming in Stata, R, or other languages. Experience working on education policy research projects. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills. An ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously to successful completion. Strong attention to detail. Comfort working independently and as part of a team. Basic knowledge of education policy in the U.S. (specific knowledge of education datasets is a plus). A demonstrated interest in education policy and share Urban’s belief that “power through knowledge” can help all people thrive in a fast-changing world. What You’ll Experience: No matter your role with Urban, you will contribute to meaningful work that makes a difference for people and communities across the country.
