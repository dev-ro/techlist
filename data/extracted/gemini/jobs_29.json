        "description": "Why Shiftsmart We’re building the Amazon of labor. We’re a labor platform pairing end-to-end workforce management technology with a rapidly growing global network of 3M flexible workers (ranked #3 in the App Store) to create scalable labor solutions for the largest companies and government agencies in the world like Walmart, PepsiCo, Google, and Circle K. Our unique business model fractionalizes jobs down to shifts and makes it easy for workers to work across multiple employers through a digital marketplace. We’re one of the fastest-growing scaleups in the country. We’ve grown 2-3x each year since we started and raised $120M+ from top-tier investors including D1 Capital & Imaginary Ventures… and we’re only getting started. Mission: What we do and why we need you The mission of the BizOps team is to design, build, execute, and optimize end-to-end initiatives that move the needle for our business combining data-driven thinking with a pragmatic first principles approach. Initiatives could include launching and expanding new customers, developing ways to increase shift rates and worker quality, improving the worker experience to increase retention and lifetime value, or designing mechanisms to identify, attract, hire, and sustain the best talent in the world across functions. This role is based in New York City (HQ) with typically 3+ days per week in the office. Outcomes: What problems you will solve Your role will evolve over time but some of your early responsibilities will include; Process Improvements: Build, scale, and optimize business processes aligned to the shift and/or worker value chain in order to enable allocation expansion, increase shift fill rates, and improve worker quality and performance across verticals and at scale through the lens of our digital product Analytics + ROI Optimization: Define metrics and create dashboards to measure product performance. Generate data-driven insights to inform product strategy and prioritization. Own analytics for each of your deals to ensure 100% shift fulfillment, identify opportunities for process improvement across the value chain, and own constant improvement on ROI and cost efficiency to deliver 100% fulfillment with efficient spend. Build and Execute: Own analytics initiatives that support daily operations such as building the data architecture, identifying opportunities using data and first principles, and build reports to summarize, monitor, and illustrate progress to capturing them (e.g., worker retention curves) Cross-functional collaborations: You will work as a key liaison between product, revenue, and partner growth teams. You will work with product to continue iterating on operator tools that deliver the best fulfillment, parter growth to ensure sufficient capacity across regions to enable shift fill, and our revenue teams to ensure the best outcomes for our customers. Experiment and test: Design, execute, and analyze A/B testing experiments to validate product hypotheses Competencies: Who you are Do you have what it takes to design, launch, and scale initiatives to fundamentally change labor? Here are the attributes you’ll need: Analytically-minded: You have 3-6+ years experience in an analytical role (e.g. data analyst, bizops, consulting, investment banking), and ideally in startups. Technical skills: You have strong experience with both Excel and SQL and can blend quantitative data with qualitative insights to test hypotheses. You also have some exposure to Python. Problem solver: You thrive working through and solving complex problems, quickly learn and adapt to new situations, and synthesize the abstract into the concrete. Highly organized: You think in systems and process, relish bringing structure to ambiguity, ruthlessly prioritize, and feel organization is second nature to you. Clear communicator: You are an excellent writer (memos, slides) and excel at making the complex simple to empower decision-making. Compensation Philosophy To provide greater transparency we share base salary ranges, which are based on role and level benchmarked against similar stage, high growth companies. Offers are determined based on multiple factors including skills, work experience, and relevant credentials. In addition to competitive salaries and meaningful equity we offer the following benefits: Comprehensive healthcare coverage: We cover 100% of employee premiums for medical, dental, and vision care (60-75% for dependents) 401(k) match program: We match 100% on the first 3% of your contributions and 50% on the next 2% for a maximum match of 4% Generous, fully paid parental and family leave policies Pre-tax commuter benefits Unlimited and flexible PTO Collaborative office with fully stocked kitchen @ 1 World Trade in Manhattan Equal opportunity employer Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status. Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart Inspired by Leadership Principles @ Amazon Execution Is Binary We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it. We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help. Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done” . Missionaries, Not Mercenaries We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane. We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them. We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too. Inputs > Outcomes We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge. We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck. We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates. We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with. Honesty Over Harmony We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst. We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow. We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it. We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later. Invent & Iterate We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done” , and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders. We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego. We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
