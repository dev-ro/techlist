By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips. The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials. While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands. Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more. Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth: Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships. Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions. Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel. Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business. Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline. Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month.

        "description": "🏛️ About GovWell We the people (and the taxpayers) deserve effective government. But the software powering government services is 20 years behind the private sector. GovWell’s mission is to build modern software products to help government serve communities better. After launching in April 2023, we now partner with government agencies in 7 states serving 200,000+ residents. GovWell has raised $5.5 million in VC funding from Work-Bench Ventures and Bienville Capital. 📜 Founding Story Our mission is deeply personal for us. Ben Cohen, Co-founder and CTO grew up helping his father — a general contractor — to apply for hundreds of construction permits. Ben’s experiences navigating clunky, outdated government websites inspired him to build better solutions for the millions of tradespeople whose livelihoods depend on getting permits fast. Prior to founding GovWell, Ben worked for Uber and Amazon as a Software Engineer, and earned his AB in Computer Science summa cum laude from Princeton. Troy LeCaire, Co-founder and CEO, was employee #1 and Chief of Staff at RippleMatch, a software startup, helping it grow from $0 to $10M in annual revenue and a $200M valuation. Before RippleMatch, he worked for two U.S. senators from his home state of Wisconsin. He believes passionately in the potential for technology to help government work more effectively for citizens everywhere. Troy earned his BA in Government magna cum laude from Cornell. 💻 What You’ll Do Build a product that will be used at scale by cities, counties, and citizens across the United States. GovWell is the primary workspace and system of record for our users - government staff typically use it 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Additionally, thousands of citizens use GovWell to access government services. You’ll see the direct impact of your work and receive immediate feedback with each new feature. Make an impact in an underserved, but societally important industry. We deserve effective, transparent government, but the overwhelming majority of cities and counties lack the modern software necessary to deliver it. GovWell is changing that. Learn how to build a company from zero to one. As employee #7 and engineer #2, you’ll see the entire startup journey. If you want to start your own company someday, there’s no better way to learn. 🧮 Technical challenges GovWell is solving Building a workflow management system that is powerful and easy to use, but flexible enough to accommodate the unique processes of 80,000+ government agencies in the United States (think: Salesforce for governments). Today, GovWell is used to process permit and license applications for everything from new affordable housing developments to small business licenses. Enabling a Figma-style document review experience that helps governments easily collaborate to review, mark up, and approve technical documents such as building and development plans. Developing a flexible and powerful document generation system to automatically generate official documents including permits and licenses for thousands of unique processes (think: Canva for documents). Creating a payments experience that makes it easy for citizens to pay billions in annual permit/license fees, property taxes, and utility bills online. 🖥️ Our Tech Stack RedwoodJS is our fullstack framework Our front-end is written in React and TypeScript Our back-end is written in TypeScript with NodeJS We use GraphQL to communicate between front-end and back-end 🧠 Who you are 5+ years of frontend development You've built a frontend system from scratch, knowing the intimate details of how data flows to/from every section of the system. If most of your experience is in creating component libraries or writing simple display components in React, this role is likely not right for you - but check back in a year! You are a frontend engineer who loves building products that real people use every day You’d rather have a challenging adventure than “rest and vest”. You are excited about quickly responding to customer feedback with feature updates. You're motivated by having a positive impact in the world You have a strong product sense and customer-focused mindset You align closely with our Core Values and have passion for our mission ➕ Nice to haves BA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent Startup experience 💸 Salary and benefits Compensation within the posted salary band will be commensurate with experience. All offers will include: Competitive base salary Equity / stock options Up to 100% of premiums paid by GovWell for medical, dental, and vision insurance for yourself + partner Unlimited / flexible PTO 🏙️ Location The founders are both located in New York City and work in person 3-4 days per week at our office in Manhattan (28th and Park, next to the 6 train).

        "description": "About Treeswift Treeswift is revolutionizing decision-making for large-scale landscapes and critical infrastructure in the face of rising threats like severe storms and wildfires. After cutting our teeth developing AI models for forests in the timber sector, we are growing in the utility sector. In the U.S. alone, hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission lines and millions of miles of distribution lines need to be monitored and managed to reduce hazards, such as encroaching vegetation that can cause outages or fires. With the rapid growth of renewable energy this infrastructure footprint is expected to more than double in the coming years creating more assets to defend than ever before. Treeswift’s mission is to deliver effective scalable technology to manage the landscapes around large-scale distributed infrastructure. We do so by innovating across the technical stack. Data is collected by our sensor packs mounted on backpacks and vehicles to seamlessly integrate into customer operations. We then leverage AI (i.e. computer vision, etc…) to transform collected data into actionable insights delivered to decision-makers in our software platform. We are early in our journey and focused on finding ground truth by working closely with our customers and using this understanding to deliver a product that delivers real value. To tackle this challenge we have brought together mission-driven robotics experts from top academic institutions (Penn, CalTech, etc…) and professionals with deep industry experience (Palantir) in enterprise software development. We hope you’ll join us. What You Will Do You are a highly skilled and motivated Software Engineer. You will: Lead development of our customer-facing web experience from day one. We have a massive opportunity to deliver value through a first-class software experience – starting with vegetation management decision-makers, and eventually extending to operators of our robots and other use cases. You will take the leading role in building and launching our software platform by working closely with our very engaged early customers and other team members. Move fast. Then help us scale. You are excited to be part of something early and be extremely hands-on to iterate quickly on early MVPs. You are motivated to make technical solutions that are resilient for the future, but can discern what is important when and prioritize enabling business outcomes. You are prepared to grow with Treeswift and build towards a secure, reliable and scalable solution as our customer base expands. Stay curious, collaborative and customer-focused. You are excited about working on a small interdisciplinary team and focused on making the best decisions for our customers. We are thoughtful about how our hardware, algorithms and software decisions all interact to compose the final product and this interaction is something that is exciting to you. As our first full stack software engineering hire you will be a big part of setting an engineering culture that makes Treeswift a great place to work. This is a full-time, hybrid (2-3 day a week in person) role, based out of our NYC office. Required Skills You have Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree. 5-10 years of full-stack software development experience. You have built web applications in a commercial context, both in early stage fast-moving settings and at larger user scales with meaningful reliability and security requirements. Proficiency with programming languages such as Javascript, Python, or similar languages. Experience with React (Preferred) or other FE framework. Experience with user authentication is a plus. You are excited to own end-to-end feature development independently, are a fan of front-end work and motivated to deliver a high-quality UI/UX. You are not afraid to pick up new skills or interact across the technical stack to do so. You are prepared to be the anchor member of Treeswift’s platform development team and make early decisions around our tooling and architecture. You are comfortable standing up CI/CD processes/tooling from scratch. You are excited about collaborating across disciplines and upskilling others to contribute. Preferred Skills Experience with geospatial and imagery data. Native mobile app development experience. Experience with technologies we use: Postgres, AWS What We Value Mission first. We value low ego team members who focus on working towards the best outcomes for the customer and the business, regardless of who gets the credit. Truth seeking.

        "description": "🏛️ About GovWell We the people (and the taxpayers) deserve effective government. But the software powering government services is 20 years behind the private sector. GovWell’s mission is to build modern software products to help government serve communities better. After launching in April 2023, we now partner with government agencies in 7 states serving 200,000+ residents. GovWell has raised $5.5 million in VC funding from Work-Bench Ventures and Bienville Capital. 📜 Founding Story Our mission is deeply personal for us. Ben Cohen, Co-founder and CTO grew up helping his father — a general contractor — to apply for hundreds of construction permits. Ben’s experiences navigating clunky, outdated government websites inspired him to build better solutions for the millions of tradespeople whose livelihoods depend on getting permits fast. Prior to founding GovWell, Ben worked for Uber and Amazon as a Software Engineer, and earned his AB in Computer Science summa cum laude from Princeton. Troy LeCaire, Co-founder and CEO, was employee #1 and Chief of Staff at RippleMatch, a software startup, helping it grow from $0 to $10M in annual revenue and a $200M valuation. Before RippleMatch, he worked for two U.S. senators from his home state of Wisconsin. He believes passionately in the potential for technology to help government work more effectively for citizens everywhere. Troy earned his BA in Government magna cum laude from Cornell. 💻 What You’ll Do Build a product that will be used at scale by cities, counties, and citizens across the United States. GovWell is the primary workspace and system of record for our users - government staff typically use it 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Additionally, thousands of citizens use GovWell to access government services. You’ll see the direct impact of your work and receive immediate feedback with each new feature. Make an impact in an underserved, but societally important industry. We deserve effective, transparent government, but the overwhelming majority of cities and counties lack the modern software necessary to deliver it. GovWell is changing that. Learn how to build a company from zero to one. As employee #7 and engineer #2, you’ll see the entire startup journey. If you want to start your own company someday, there’s no better way to learn. 🧮 Technical challenges GovWell is solving Building a workflow management system that is powerful and easy to use, but flexible enough to accommodate the unique processes of 80,000+ government agencies in the United States (think: Salesforce for governments). Today, GovWell is used to process permit and license applications for everything from new affordable housing developments to small business licenses. Enabling a Figma-style document review experience that helps governments easily collaborate to review, mark up, and approve technical documents such as building and development plans. Developing a flexible and powerful document generation system to automatically generate official documents including permits and licenses for thousands of unique processes (think: Canva for documents). Creating a payments experience that makes it easy for citizens to pay billions in annual permit/license fees, property taxes, and utility bills online. 🖥️ Our Tech Stack RedwoodJS is our fullstack framework Our front-end is written in React and TypeScript Our back-end is written in TypeScript with NodeJS We use GraphQL to communicate between front-end and back-end 🧠 Who you are 4+ years of fullstack development You have extensive experience owning features end-to-end. You love to take Figma designs and make modifications to the database setup, backend code, and frontend code to make those designs come to life. You have a strong product mindset: you love to ask questions and are obsessed with deeply understanding customer journeys using the product. You’d rather have a challenging adventure than “rest and vest”. You are excited about quickly responding to customer feedback with feature updates. You're motivated by having a positive impact in the world You align closely with our Core Values and have passion for our mission ➕ Nice to haves BA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent Startup experience 💸 Salary and benefits Compensation within the posted salary band will be commensurate with experience. All offers will include: Competitive base salary Equity / stock options Up to 100% of premiums paid by GovWell for medical, dental, and vision insurance for yourself + partner Unlimited / flexible PTO 🏙️ Location The founders are both located in New York City and work in person 3-4 days per week at our office in Manhattan (28th and Park, next to the 6 train). We strongly prefer NYC-based candidates, but are open to exceptional remote candidates. Compensation Range: $165K - $185K",

After creating and releasing PyTorch Lightning in 2019, Lightning AI was launched to reshape the development of artificial intelligence products for commercial and academic use. Focusing on simplicity, sustainability, modularity, and extensibility, Lightning AI streamlines the lifecycle of machine learning development to expand widespread AI adoption. Its aim is to enable individual and enterprise users to build deployment-ready AI tools without having to hire experts or sink resources into in-house infrastructure. Lightning AI is a company with offices in New York City, Palo Alto, and London backed by $58.6 million in funding from Coatue, Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Our Values We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society.

Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.

        "description": "Figma is growing our team of passionate people on a mission to make design accessible to all. Born on the Web, Figma helps entire product teams brainstorm, design and build better products — from start to finish. Whether it’s consolidating tools, simplifying workflows, or collaborating across teams and time zones, Figma makes the design process faster, more efficient, and fun while keeping everyone on the same page. From great products to long-lasting companies, we believe that nothing great is made alone—come make with us! Within the Figma Editor, Figma’s industry-leading collaborative design product, Design Systems is one of the most critical features that enables teams to scale their designs. Every day, our users leverage design systems to create, share and reuse design elements, in order to ensure design consistency across their brand and products and accelerate a designer’s workflow. The Design Systems team is responsible for providing powerful features and delightful user experiences for the life cycle of building, managing and consuming design systems. Design Systems is a full stack product, hence it fully leverages the Figma Editor’s technical stack: everything you see on the canvas in the Figma Editor uses C++ , which compiles to WebAssembly to run in the browser and offer more control over performance, memory management, and rendering. We use Typescript and React/Redux for the UI around the canvas, where key elements like the properties panel, toolbar, and modals live. Typescript gives us type checking capability, more guardrails around code correctness, and allows us to generate HTML and CSS in order to take advantage of more standard UI patterns. We have a service-oriented architecture and use Ruby/Sinatra, Go, and Rust on the backend for Figma’s main API server. Professional experience with these languages and technologies is not a requirement. We encourage candidates to use the programming language that they’re most comfortable with during interviews—new hires will be ramped in our codebase during onboarding. Figma is a highly collaborative organization. You’ll form strong relationships with product managers and designers, and can expect to partner regularly with engineers and leaders beyond your immediate team.

What you'll do at Figma: Building new features in a real time, multiplayer system with a complex data model that enables collaboration across files. Designing large-scale application architecture and state management. Solving for performance and memory optimizations—we want to keep pushing the limits of what is possible to create in a browser while maintaining a highly performant UX. Extending and scaling the Editor and full stack system behind our design system features, enabling teams to build best-in-class design systems that work well with production components. Contributing to mapping out an accessibility strategy, which may include improvements to the Figma UI (contrast, keyboard navigability, etc.) as well as tools to help people generate accessible content as they do their own work. We’d love to hear from you if you have: 6+ years of professional experience building and shipping user-facing features and products, or platforms that power multiple features, including 2+ years of experience operating in a technical lead capacity. Strong ability to understand user experiences and product requirements and translate into high quality technical solutions. Deep understanding of systems and proven ability to solve problems without known solutions or creates new architecture that solves multiple problems within complex systems. Demonstrated fluency with one or more programming languages, including: Typescript/Javascript, React, C++, Python, Java, Objective-C, Go, or Rust. Excellent technical communication and relationship-building skills. The ability to achieve successful outcomes with partners ranging from interns to executives.

Founded in 2022 by former fixed income quants at leading prop shops, Moment has quickly established itself as the leading fixed income infrastructure provider for global fintechs, traditional brokerages, and RIAs. Fixed income is the largest asset class in the world, and the market is evolving rapidly. In the past three years, electronic fixed income trading volume has nearly doubled — and in the past 14 months, retail fixed income trading volume has increased by more than 1500%. Despite this rapid growth, the wealth management space has been confined to legacy technology that doesn’t meet their needs anymore. That’s where Moment comes in — in just a matter of weeks, Moment allows customers to easily offer an end-to-end, modern fixed income solution through a simple set of APIs across data, execution, and portfolio management. Most startups start off serving small businesses, and scale up as they convince larger enterprises to take a bet. Moment’s version of “small businesses” have been firms representing millions of retail investors — and we’re just getting started.

        "description": "Seqera exists to make complex scientific data analysis accessible at any scale. Empowering scientists with modern software engineering for data analysis We provide software for scientists solving today's most complex and important challenges from pioneering innovative therapeutics to unveiling the secrets of our universe. The journey began a decade ago with Nextflow — open software that helps over 100,000 global scientists analyze and process data, with more power and flexibility than ever before. Today, Seqera consolidates fragmented data and diverse computing resources into a unified platform. Our modern biotech stack is trusted by over 150 leading life sciences organizations. Empowered with modern software engineering, organizations conduct science faster, on larger datasets, and with more confidence. Seqera accelerates discoveries in an open world. Would you like to be a part of a company with a bigger purpose and make it successful with your own ideas? If yes, keep reading! About The Role We are seeking a versatile Senior Software Engineer for our “Seqera Platform” team: a customer-facing product delivered both as a cloud and an on-premises solution that enables scientists to solve complex problems in biotech with modern tools at their fingertips and also provides administrators and collaborators the access they need to scientific research. The ideal candidate is passionate about addressing a wide range of technical challenges—not just frontend or backend, but also complex problems involving infrastructure, distributed programming, containerization, cloud architectures, and integrations. Working on the Seqera Platform is an exciting opportunity to learn and work with a diverse range of technologies. We are committed to building a process where we can deliver high-quality products and iterate fast, which requires us to develop solid engineering practices that include end-to-end testing, observability frameworks, deployment standards, automation, and operational excellence processes. Note: We're open to hiring you in New York (US), London (UK) or Barcelona (Spain). We are unable to provide visa sponsorship at this time. What You'll Do Design, implement, and maintain efficient, reusable, and reliable code across our full software stack. Engage extensively with your product team and cross-functionally, interpreting and integrating customer feedback into the development cycle to ensure our products not only meet but exceed user expectations. Collaborate with fellow engineers on building engineering best practices, improving processes, documentation, and onboarding artifacts. Help with hiring and onboarding, identify and prioritize the technical roadmap items to generate a valuable impact on the engineering culture at Seqera. Rapidly iterate on MVP-stage features and products while keeping an eye towards extracting learnings to inform our long-term platform roadmap Promote technical best practices with teammates and serve as a design partner to both senior and junior colleagues Flex your engineering capabilities outside of your comfort zone when necessary and be unafraid to work on unfamiliar problems and with new technologies About You You're a software engineer with experience developing robust and scalable solutions. You're passionate about solving real-world problems with proven technologies and building elegant, scalable systems. You write simple, sophisticated, well-structured and well-tested code that drives new features and improvements. You have worked in a collaborative agile environment through the whole application lifecycle using languages like Java and Groovy, as well as backend and frontend frameworks like Micronaut, Angular, Rails, React, Spring, Flask etc. Expertise in Java is a solid plus; in its absence, experience in similar languages and the ability to learn rapidly is important. You are comfortable with ambiguity - you’re able to quickly develop hypotheses with limited information and have a demonstrated ability to learn complex concepts quickly. You drive tasks independently, while proactively reaching out for help and additional resources when needed to keep yourself unblocked. You have built strong foundational knowledge in software engineering with experience in both front-end and back-end development: confident and proficient in implementing efficient algorithms, using best practices in coding standards, and adhering to security measures to protect data integrity and prevent vulnerabilities. Experience with cloud architectures and cloud application deployments, having worked with at least one major cloud provider ( such as AWS) and built distributed architecture on top of its service offering. Nice to Have: Familiarity with container technologies and orchestration solutions such as Kubernetes and/or Docker Compose. Nice to have: Knowledge of HPC and Batch solutions both on-premise and in the cloud (AWS Batch, Google Batch, and/or Azure Batch) Experience with Angular. Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply for jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Seqera, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role and your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles. What will you find working at Seqera? Flexible working hours and remote-friendly culture. International working environment with more than 25 nationalities. Passionate & talented team. Continuous skills development. Team retreats and bonding activities. A culture where your opinion is valued and your decisions have a real impact on the industry. Excitement of a fast-growing startup in a constantly changing environment. Great Benefits Time off: 20 days for vacations per year, 3 days given by Seqera in December of 2024, and the national/public holidays according to your location. Equity Private health insurance with United Healthcare, dental with Delta, and vision coverage from Vision Service Plan. Private life insurance with Lincoln Investment app with Vestwell (401K) Home office equipment (valued over 1,000 USD) Subscription to Oliva, Mental Health App Learning and development budget per year (1,000 USD) You should know Seqera is proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. However you identify or whatever your journey to this point, we welcome all candidates to apply for the position that inspires them. Come join us and help us build a global company that everyone is proud to be part of. As we scale, we constantly improve our in-office and WFH environments and learn to help everyone have the best setup for our company's success and your personal development while always keeping the human touch in every aspect of our lives.

        "description": "Hi! We're Forerunner. We believe that climate adaptation is a necessity, not a luxury, and communities deserve access to powerful software that helps them plan for the future. The challenge of climate change is complex – it implicates how municipalities plan, manage capital, and communicate to both residents and higher levels of government. Forerunner helps local communities do these things better by empowering them to access, understand, and mobilize local-level flood risk data at scale. The Role The engineering team at Forerunner strives to be small but dedicated, working relentlessly to help local governmental bodies and their floodplain managers reason about the flooding risks that all communities face in the USA. The domain is complicated, nuanced, and rapidly changing, and we at Forerunner break down this complexity for our users so they can do what truly matters - fight against climate change and the possible loss of homes in the case of flooding. Engineers at Forerunner can work remotely from anywhere within the United States , so long as they are willing to work on either Eastern or Central timezones. We offer schedule flexibility and ask for accountability in return. We are unable to sponsor H1-B visas at this time, so permanent residency or citizenship is required. Our tech stack and other engineering tools include, but are not limited to: Typescript / React.js / React Native frontend with jest for testing GraphQL API powered by a Node.js / Typescript backend with jest for testing. Postgres as our database, alongside heavy use of postgis git , Github and Github Actions for code review and CI Deployment to AWS using ECS and similar products While expertise with all of the technologies above is by no means not necessary, a working understanding of at least a few of them is required. We strongly encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply - the problem of climate change has an impact on all of us, and we want to reflect that within our team's composition. What You'll Do A Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Forerunner has the following responsibilities: Build, test, and review software on a day-to-day basis, working within our frontends, backends, and with the underlying data modeling that underpins them. This means working on a postgres query one day and on a React component the next, all the while making sure this work is adequately tested. Do the occasional dev-ops and support work. We use AWS as our cloud provider, but we have no dedicated SRE or dev-ops team, and so sometimes engineers may have to help with the plumbing. Occasionally pair-program with and help mentor peers. This means hoping on a Slack or Zoom call with another engineer to collaborate on a particularly thorny piece of code or to talk through different approaches that can be used to solve the problem at hand. Help plan medium- to large-sized projects across the stack. The engineering team gives all engineers the opportunity to plan out and execute on large features, and as a senior engineer, you'd be responsible from the more time-sensitive, complicated projects. Seek out clarity in the face of ambiguity. Domain expertise is always hard to come by and benefits from dedicated time and curiosity - we are learning a lot from our partners and this reflects in the work we do, so ask questions. Communicate clearly, whether in a stand-up meeting, planning meeting, or otherwise. We're a small team working entirely remotely, which requires us to be prompt and clear with both written and spoken communication. What We Offer Forerunner is an early stage company with an interdisciplinary team. We are motivated by seemingly intractable problems and work hard to support one another. We're mission-driven. Our mission orients our business strategy and pushes us to work with a sense of urgency. We're in the weeds - our entire team spends time engaging with our partners in the field to better understand the real-world problems they face. We're a small team. As a member of our growing team, you will quickly become an invaluable part of our organization and have a meaningful impact on our business and technical direction. We welcome unique perspectives and backgrounds. Your opinion matters and we hope you'll share it. We build each other up. A team works best when its members are adequately equipped with the tools to tackle the problems they are facing. Forerunner strives to provide adequate feedback and appropriate learning opportunities to help all its team members expand their skills. We want you to be happy and healthy. Forerunner offers competitive compensation, health/vision/dental coverage, a 401k plan, and one expensed lunch per week. We also have a quarterly wellness reimbursement so that you can have flexibility in defining what \"health\" means to you. The salary range for this position is $140,000-$190,000. This posting may span more than one career level. Compensation is determined based on a variety of factors, including an individual's skills, experience, qualifications, and working location.",

        "description": "About Openmesh and Xnode Today a handful of corporations control 90% of the world's data and IT infrastructure and we are expected to trust them. This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data. Openmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data. Openmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless. Core Products Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time. Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products. Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved. Our vision Our vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.

        "description": "Old problem, new $25B+ market Companies like AWS, Stripe, and Twilio have shown that if a technology isn't core to your value proposition, you should offload it. Still, every engineering team builds and rebuilds one piece: authorization , how you control who has access to what in your app. We intend to change that. We see a world where developers never roll their own authorization again, and instead say, \"Just use Oso\" – the same way you might say, \"Oh, you should just use Postgres for that.\" In doing so, we're creating the $25B+ authorization market. Why Oso? We have the lead – in traction, capital, and team. Traction: Oso is used by thousands of companies from startups to the Fortune 500, like Wayfair, Arc, Intercom, Visa, Oxide, and Codecademy. Capital: We're the best-capitalized, with 4+ years of runway from the world’s best investors, including Sequoia, Felicis, and infrastructure entrepreneurs like Olivier Pomel (Founder, Datadog), Dev Ittycheria (CEO, MongoDB), Arman Dadgar (Founder, Hashicorp), Edith Harbaugh (Founder, LaunchDarkly), Guy Podjarny (Founder, Snyk), Paul Copplestone, (Founder, Supabase), Christina Cacioppo (Founder, Vanta), and Calvin French-Owen (Founder, Segment). Team: We've spent 3+ years going deep on the domain. We've met with thousands of engineering teams and know more about this problem than anyone. And we have two of the best developer go-to-market leaders on earth who have done it before at MongoDB and Snyk. Why now? We're at an inflection point. What it takes to get from where we are today to a world where developers say “Just use Oso” is going to be different. And we see that. The opportunity is for you to join at this inflection point, in a role that’s bigger and different than usual. What you'll do Experiment, design, and build UIs, flows, features, and layers of abstraction that decrease the amount of work our users have to do. Lots of devex Expand use case coverage of our core authorization service Build and operate infrastructure for our highly available and low latency cloud service Plus, help build a company and community from the ground up by wearing other hats, including: Writing documentation and blog posts to excite and support new users Engaging with users through support channels (e.g., Slack) to help them with their problems Here are examples of things we've worked on: Built a visual policy builder for our declarative policy language, Polar Built an interactive debugger, called Explain, to help users understand why authorization requests succeed or fail Implemented incremental forward chaining to cache authorization responses for deeply nested recursive queries Who you are You're ambitious. You want to win big. You can't stand to be around anything but execution at the highest level. You have an inner motor to move fast. You're an owner. You are accountable to results over the process. You see yourself not just as an engineer, but also as an owner of the company. You're resilient. Building a startup is not for the faint of heart. You see the challenges as not just normal, but actually desirable. You want to grow, and help others grow. You self-reflect often. You give feedback, and you seek it out. You prioritize the customer above all else. You want to understand our users' world and prioritize solving their authorization problems above everything else. Requirements You have 4+ years of experience as a software engineer You have worked at a startup or in a similar environment You have worked on developer experience and/or user experience You can program at different levels of the stack – i.e., frontend and backend, web app to lower level systems The starting salary for this role is between $100,000-$500,000/year plus equity. Your exact offer will vary based on a number of factors including experience level, skillset, market location, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. A note on titles: We have no titles on our engineering team. Everyone is an Engineer. Compensation is commensurate with contribution. For more background, read this blog post. Oso is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or disability status.",

As a member of the team you'll participate in our fully Agile development process, including all Agile ceremonies (stand-up, Iteration Planning, Demos and Retros). Our User-Centered Design process offers the opportunity to receive weekly input and feedback from our end-user customers as we Literatively develop and deploy our features! As part of the development process, you will solve unique and complex problems, using the latest technologies to create innovative solutions that are highly scalable and secure and deploy to a fully automated DevOps pipeline.

We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning. Flex Time Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st. Individual Benefits Account (IBA) To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset - the employee. The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as: Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental 100% Medical Reimbursement Time Off with Pay Profit Sharing Plan 401k Educational Benefits Additional Income IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary. Profit Sharing Plan (PSP) The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP. Stock Options Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company. Lifelong Learning Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through the use of company provided online learning opportunities, periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.

        "description": "Northstrat is seeking an experienced and driven Senior Full Stack Developer to join our dynamic team. The ideal candidate will have extensive experience in both back-end and front-end development, bringing a wealth of knowledge in multiple programming languages and frameworks. This role demands a self-starter who can take vaguely defined tasks and independently deliver high-quality solutions. Requirements Must have at least 8 plus years of relevant experience with a master's in computer science, or 10 plus years of relevant experience with a bachelor's in computer science Must be U.S. citizen with the ability to obtain a government clearance Proficiency in Java, C++, Rust, and advanced Python (Back-End Development) Proficiency in JavaScript frameworks including React, Angular, and Node.js. and data Structures (Front-End Development) Tangible experience designing, programming and implementing large complex systems Strong analytical skills and the ability to troubleshoot complex issues Benefits Work/Life Balance Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning. Flex Time Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st. Individual Benefits Account (IBA) To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset - the employee. The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as: Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental 100% Medical Reimbursement Time Off with Pay Profit Sharing Plan 401k Educational Benefits Additional Income IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary. Profit Sharing Plan (PSP) The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP. Stock Options Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company. Lifelong Learning Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through the use of company provided online learning opportunities, periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities. Bring Your True Self We embrace diversity and encourage inclusion. We support employee led interest groups and challenge our employees to support others and be their best self. We are so true to our beliefs that we offer employee referral incentives. When you like it here, your friends and family will too!
