        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The Payins organization builds products and platforms to help users accept payments from customers, including the APIs for configuring and processing payments, and Cards, our highest volume and most complex method for accepting payments. We are hiring for multiple teams within the Payins organization and we will determine exact team alignment in the final stages of the process. What you’ll do Responsibilities Scope, design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and large-scale systems that reliably and efficiently handle billions of money movement requests. Apply a detail-oriented mindset to dissect information, analyze data, and detect patterns that lead to cost savings Debug and solve critical production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack Mentor early-career engineers to help them grow Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to build new features at large-scale, while improving internal engineering standards, tooling, and processes Collaborate effectively in a distributed and hybrid team, maintaining open communication and strong connections with colleagues Who you are We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements A strong technical background, including 5+ years of software engineering or a similar experience. Experience with project leadership and mentoring engineers. Familiarity with the full life cycle of software development, from design and implementation to testing and deployment. Strong coding skills for building high performance services. Strong analytical capability especially in modeling complex business flows and turning the business requirements into programmatic artifacts such as data models, algorithms, and API designs. Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different areas of expertise. Engineering works closely with a variety of teams: Sales and Support to better understand our customers’ needs, Legal and Accounting to understand how global policies influence our money-moving infrastructure, etc. Preferred Qualifications Prior knowledge in financial technology space, particularly in payment processing Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $157,600 - $244,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

We build a simple but powerful platform that helps manufacturers reduce costs, increase visibility, and drive efficiency. We believe in keeping things simple and easy-to-understand - and our culture and products are a reflection of that. For example, it takes a few minutes to self-install Amper on any kind of industrial machine - like a consumer device and without the traditional hassle of integration. Our vision is to build the market-leading FactoryOS to enable cutting-edge operations, and we are investing in the next level of growth across our GTM and product teams.

We build for both web and mobile, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.

We are the people behind the tech. And when it's good, we look for better. We don't over think the value we bring nor spend time trying to revamp mantras.
