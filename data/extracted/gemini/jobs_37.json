Develops, creates, maintains, and writes/codes new (or modifies existing) computer applications, software, or specialized utility programs. Analyze information to determine, recommend, and plan the development of a new application or modification of an existing application. Analyze user needs and software requirements to determine feasibility of design within time and cost constraints. Apply coding and testing standards, apply security testing tools including \"'fuzzing\" static-analysis code scanning tools, and conduct code reviews. Apply secure code documentation. Capture security controls used during the requirements phase to integrate security within the process, to identify key security objectives, and to maximize software security while minimizing disruption to plans and schedules. Compile and write documentation of program development and subsequent revisions, inserting comments in the coded instructions so others can understand the program. Confer with systems analysts, engineers, programmers, and others to design application and to obtain information on project limitations and capabilities, performance requirements, and interfaces. Consult with engineering staff to evaluate interface between hardware and software. Correct errors by making appropriate changes and rechecking the program to ensure that desired results are produced. Design, develop, and modify software systems, using scientific analysis and mathematical models to predict and measure outcome and consequences of design. Develop secure code and error handling. Evaluate factors such as reporting formats required, cost constraints, and need for security restrictions to determine hardware configuration. Identify basic common coding flaws at a high level. Identify security implications and apply methodologies within centralized and decentralized environments across the enterprise's computer systems in software development. Identify security issues around steady state operation and management of software and incorporate security measures that must be taken when a product reaches its end of life. Perform integrated quality assurance testing for security functionality and resiliency attack. Perform secure programming and identify potential flaws in codes to mitigate vulnerabilities. Perform risk analysis (e.g., threat, vulnerability, and probability of occurrence) whenever an application or system undergoes a major change. Prepare detailed workflow charts and diagrams that describe input, output, and logical operation, and convert them into a series of instructions coded in a computer language. Address security implications in the software acceptance phase including completion criteria, risk acceptance and documentation, common criteria, and methods of independent testing. Store, retrieve, and manipulate data for analysis of system capabilities and requirements. Translate security requirements into application design elements including documenting the elements of the software attack surfaces, conducting threat modeling, and defining any specific security criteria. Design countermeasures and mitigations against potential exploitations of programming language weaknesses and vulnerabilities in system and elements. Identify and leverage the enterprise-wide version control system while designing and developing secure applications. Consult with customers about software system design and maintenance.

Then, you can choose to apply directly with Salvo Health or use AI to assist your application powered by Offered. Salvo is a new approach to help millions of Americans facing chronic health conditions, centered on chronic gut health and metabolic conditions from IBS to obesity. Our patients are assigned a “whole patient” care team and have seven day a week access to app-based care, using Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”) to bill under the patient’s insurance. This is a major step forward to go beyond episodic appointments to continuous care at home, and deliver interdisciplinary wraparound care in partnership with the patient’s existing local doctor. Salvo is backed by leading health care investors from innovators like Livongo, Ro, Ginger, Forward, Brightline, Tia, and others. Salvo care draws on expertise from Board-certified specialty physicians, registered dietitians, nurses, psychologists, and therapists who have developed our evidence-based protocols, for a personalized, multi-month journey to better health. Salvo is the first to bring a scalable and tech-enabled, more integrative approach to these chronic conditions, going beyond treating only the symptoms in order to identify and address the root causes of chronic illness. As a Software Engineer, you will contribute to frontend, backend, and mobile applications up and down the stack. As a small team, we highly value the ability to learn quickly and participate in a shared responsibility for all the elements of our product. You will report to the Head of Engineering.

We are committed to providing an environment of mutual respect where equal employment opportunities are available to all applicants and teammates. A core mission is to increase access to better and more convenient care for patients, especially among Millennial and GenZ women whose complaints are often not taken seriously by the existing medical system. Many of our patients struggle to get access to the right doctor given the shortage of specialists, and often their doctors are not trained in the relevant areas of behavioral medicine, nor have the financial incentives to give daily support for follow-up care. Salvo aims to offer a comprehensive benefits package to support our employees. Aside from a competitive salary and a remote-first environment, we offer medical/dental/vision insurance, membership to One Medical, a 401k program, generous PTO, and more!",

        "description": "Company Description Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Our platform is built on AWS, is serverless-first and consists of hundreds of Node.js microservices that run across thousands of AWS Lambda functions. With a loosely coupled architecture and aggressive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing coverage, each microservice is tied to a continuing integration & delivery pipeline that allows us to deploy to production dozens, sometimes hundreds, of times per day.
