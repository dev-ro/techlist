        "description": "The Opportunity $1.5 trillion of agricultural commodities move around the world every year. They help feed us, fuel us, and clothe us. Petrichor’s vision is to enable any food manufacturer, agribusiness, or raw materials processor to build, scale, and manage their multi-tiered supply chains for the modern, global economy. Our mission is to make commerce easy and accessible for food companies and agribusinesses so they can make better decisions about when to buy, when to sell, and how to manage risk for their ingredient supply chains, from anywhere in the world. We accomplish this by building connected software and services for the business functions associated with the physical and financial flow of raw materials. Petrichor integrates, automates, and provides real-time visibility into these information flows and trading processes to enable more responsive, efficient, and sustainable supply chains. The mission of the Senior Full Stack Developer is to design, engineer, and release successive modules on our platform. The Senior Full Stack Developer will have line responsibility for supporting the initial planning and design through to implementation and maintenance of some of our core features, such as logistics visibility and inventory management. This individual will work directly with product, sales, and engineering teams to support continued feature development and additional releases over the next several years. As a Chicago-based, venture-backed startup, Petrichor has an ambitious product roadmap and growth goals over the next several years. This role will be based out of our Chicago headquarters with a return-to-office model beginning in late 2022. We’re humbled to be responsible for mission-critical elements of our customers’ business operations. We thrive in going after complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted problems. We are looking for those who want to join a high-performance, fast-paced, customer-focused culture. You Will Design, build, test, and launch the initial version of Petrichor's logistics visibility and inventory management modules, helping automate customer workflows Refactoring and modifying of existing proof of concept will represent approximately 10-20% of the time and effort New product development will account for the remaining 80-90% of time and effort Build out of risk reporting module, including real-time index pricing (commodity & currency), graphs, and P&L Redesign, refactoring, and feature enhancement of existing contract management modules that are live with current customers to match prototypes created by Petrichor’s product design team Support product teams in implementing our software with customers Enable customers and end-users to meet desired KPIs around usage, workflow automation, operational efficiency, time savings, and risk management Ensure software and data architecture can scale to support growth across multiple, interrelated parties of customers (commodity traders, end-use manufacturers, raw material originators, etc.) - your solutions should have scale in mind while addressing shorter-term business needs Manage integrations with third party applications, where needed, to support customer data flows into and out of Petrichor’s platform Expand, refine, and implement processes and software tools to support customers and end-users, including issue tracking; configuration management; and security / regulatory compliance The platform will require SOC 2 and GDPR compliance During third party data integrations, the Senior Full Stack Developer will be an integral part of the implementation process and provide technical support for anomaly resolution and technical / process risk closure Required Qualifications An undergraduate or graduate degree (BS/MS/PhD) in computer science, engineering, or a related discipline; or 4+ years direct experience in lieu of degree Deep knowledge in software design, data structures, and web architecture principles and protocols 3+ years of software development experience in one or more general programming languages such as Rails/Python/Java/Go; experience with Ruby on Rails is a must-have 3+ years of experience with front-end languages and libraries, such as Angular, React, and Node.js (we use React) 3+ years of experience working with Postgres or other major database solutions Production experience in AWS or Azure deployments and related capabilities such as Docker deployment Solid interpersonal skills to interact with both internal and external groups, including cross-functional teams of product designers and engineers, as well as non-technical end-users, to quickly resolve complex, multifaceted problems Proven ability to work in a high-growth, high-output, highly-dynamic and ambiguous environment (such as a startup or growth-stage company) with a strong sense of independence and bias for action is critical to success Nice-to-have Qualifications 2+ years of direct, relevant experience in software development in either enterprise software, FinTech, commodity trading, or supply chain management disciplines Full software product life cycle experience in an enterprise software context, including code reviews, source control management, testing, and continuous deployments Direct experience implementing and maintaining software with a proven focus on usability, reliability, simplicity, and security Our Culture And Values Speed and focus is how we execute on our strategy. We have a bias for action. Speed is our biggest advantage. When forced to choose between breadth versus depth, we narrow the focus and increase the quality to maintain the speed. There is no middle ground between “success” and “failure” for our customers. We are committed to ensuring our customers succeed and hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards. We act as Owners and Builders. It is unacceptable to say a problem is “above my pay grade.” When needed, we go directly to the person or team who has line responsibility for solving the problem. We perform as a team, while encouraging independent thought and rigorous debate. Whenever possible, we play the long game. When needed, we will sacrifice short-term results that are in the long-term interest of the company. Diversity is part of our foundation - our entire industry relies on groups of people from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds coming together to coordinate a single commercial transaction. You can expect to interact with users and partners who may not speak your same language or have different business customs and cultural norms. Our Engineering And Design Principles Are Dream in Years Plan in Months Evaluate in Weeks Ship Daily Prototype for 1x Build for 10x Engineer for 100x What is required to cut the timeline in half for this deliverable? What needs to be done to double the impact? How does what I’m building address a specific need or solve a specific problem for our customers? What can I do to ensure my knowledge can be shared in a timely, efficient, and clear manner? Competencies We Prioritize For This Role Execution mindset: You move quickly and take a forceful stand without being overly abrasive Persistence: You demonstrate tenacity and a willingness to go the distance to get something done Intelligence: You learn quickly and demonstrate the ability to quickly and proficiently understand and absorb new information High standards: You expect personal performance and team performance to be nothing short of the best Work ethic: You possess a strong willingness to work hard and sometimes long hours to get the job done; you have a track record of working hard Attention to detail: You do not let important details slip through the cracks or derail a project Flexibility / adaptability: You adjust quickly to changing priorities and conditions; you can effectively manage through complexity and change; relentless resourcefulness is a must-have Proactivity: You act without being told what to do, while bringing new ideas to Petrichor Questions You Should Ask Yourself Am I comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a high degree of ambiguity and risk? Do I see myself as someone who will do whatever it takes to accomplish the mission, even if that includes tedious work? Do I want to work hard in a role that requires some nights and weekends at a company that would never be described as easy? Would I enjoy working in a company that prioritizes analyzing the inputs (the quality of my work) and outcomes (what results I achieved) before focusing on the outputs (the number of hours I worked)? Am I comfortable with owning my own career outcomes as opposed to a heavily defined scope and progression? Do I enjoy taking progressively larger amounts of responsibility and like rising to the challenge when needed? Would I do well in an environment where autonomy and being a self-starter is expected? How do I respond to quality and performance standards that many people might consider unreasonably high? Am I willing to dig into the details to make sure I sufficiently understand a problem or task at all levels? Can I communicate and deliberate with conviction but also be capable of changing my mind when presented with data or information that challenges my beliefs? Once a decision is made, can I fully and wholly commit to it?",

        "description": "🔷 Overview Hi there 👋, glad that you found us! I hope that this page explains what we do pretty well. Feel free to reach out to us if there is anything unclear. Acho is building a Collaborative GUI for data engineering tasks. From building a data connector, data pipeline to supporting an application, we make Acho accessible to all members of a team regardless of their roles, technical background. Today, hundreds of business teams use Acho to transform their processes and unlock more value from their data than ever before. Team Acho is engineering-focused and collaborative. Recently closed a Seed Round by Y Combinator, VCs, and industry leaders, we are setting off to solve some of the hardest problems in the data space today. As an engineer, you'll work on a variety of interesting products and problems for our customers. You'll generate great product ideas, as well as architect, implement, and release them. We love engineers owning projects, from start to finish. For example, new features often start off as customer ideas. So it could be your responsibility to talk to the customer and scope out what a solution might look like, in addition to actually building it, testing it, documenting it, and releasing iterating on it with the customer. 💠 Qualification BS or Master degree in Computer Science 1-3 years of experience in Frontend Development You are passionate about technology and thrive in a dynamic environment with a focus on creative innovation over absolute perfection Architecting, building, and maintaining web applications Proficient in modern web client-side technologies and frameworks (Experience with Vue.js or React.js is preferred) Excellent communication skills in verbal and written English 🛠️ Necessary Skills HTML, CSS, and Javascript Modern JavaScript Framework (Experience with Vue.js is preferred) Experience with SSR SEO Optimization Webpack API Design Database (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) 🌎 Website https://acho.io/?=bookface ❓ FAQ What does the interview process look like? - We’ll reach out for an intro call after reviewing your resume. We may follow by scheduling a technical interview. If the tech round went well, we’d give you a small project. After assessing the project, we’d be ready and make an offer. Can I work remotely? - Yes. We support a hybrid of remote and on-site work environments. What’s it like working for a startup? - Being a small nimble team is the best way to grow fast both personally and collectively as a team. We tend to debunk some of the stereotypes about working at a startup. We rarely work overtime. Our processes are pretty clear and structured. Our goal is super defined. Our financial risk is actually a lot lower than a lot of established businesses as we have zero debt, fewer commitments/overheads, and actually grow each month. What can I expect in terms of compensation? - We aim to compensate competitively. Additionally, we ensure a “happy rate” and boost in pay for every milestone we achieve together. What’s unique about this role? - The Front-end will work closely with our product designer and ship amazing features that delight users. Different from the full-stack SDE position, this role will spend more time on UI/UX, design, and business logic. What’s special about team Acho? - We’re a group of builders who aren’t afraid of the toughest engineering challenges. The world as we understand it is a big puzzle with tons of problems to be solved. The bigger our goal is, the more and harder the problems become. We’d always want to be the team that solves the most, and hardest problems.",

        "description": "Enterprise software is in the midst of a revolution. The world is shifting from “systems of record” to “systems of automation” - LLM powered agents and orchestrators that perform complex business tasks on behalf of and in concert with humans, with increasing levels of autonomy. The opportunity for AI agents is dramatically larger than the opportunity for pure software; businesses spend orders of magnitude more on labor than on traditional forms of software. Every major vertical will begin to adopt AI labor, and we believe the most important companies of the AI revolution will be the ones that lead this shift. Vooma’s mission is to build the AI Agent for America’s $800+ BN trucking industry. Everything we touch in the physical world is moved on a truck - it’s the backbone of the US economy. Yet logistics today is still extremely manual, which makes it one of the hungriest industries for the shift toward AI Agents. Vooma is backed by top-tier investors and CEOs, founders and executives from Nolan, Arrive, MoLo, NFI, Convoy, Uber Freight, Motive, Loop, OTR Capital, Project44, Trucker Tools and more. We have enterprise contracts with many of the largest freight businesses in the US. This is a rare opportunity for you to join a talented and experienced team at the ground level to build a transformational company for a critical industry. About The Tech At Vooma, you’ll harness the power of LLMs to transform the way freight is executed. You’ll work with us to combine the latest in computer vision, natural language and autonomous systems to build robust AI behaviors and stunning product experiences for logistics teams that weren’t previously possible. You’ll work with a modern web stack (Next.js, GraphQL, Node) and a cutting-edge AI stack (OpenAI, Anthropic, Open-Source models). You’ll code primarily in Typescript and Python. About The Role Your role, should you choose to join us, will be a Full Stack Software Engineer in our founding team. You’re the right person for this role if you’re excited to build not just stunning products, but help shape the company’s trajectory from early days. You’re a good fit if you’re the type of person that is known by your peers to move mountains and make progress, no matter the circumstances. The ambiguity of early stage company building is thrilling to you, and you’re excited by the challenge of breathing life into things that didn’t exist before. Your Responsibilities Will Include Designing and implementing AI behaviors, along with the data and processing infrastructure to scale with our customers Working with customers across logistics to understand their needs, and design the tools that enable the AI-based workflows of the future Working closely with the founders to design, hire, and build the company from seed to success You Likely Have Experience and / or appetite for working at a startup Built and scaled a web-based product Implemented and maintained frontend and/or backend technology stacks through stages of growth Expertise in cloud infrastructure platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP Eagerness to wear multiple hats, lead new initiatives, learn new technologies, and get it done; whatever it is Compensation The rare opportunity to join a formidable team to build an enduring company, in person, as a first 10 employee Competitive compensation Significant equity upside Medical / dental / vision Location This role is based in person in San Francisco, CA (not remote).",

The Frontend Role: We're seeking a talented Front-End Engineer to join our team and help us build the next generation of anime and video game tools.

        "description": "Conduit – The Onchain Compute Company Blockchains are not only decentralized ledgers but raw sources of computing power. Like any source of raw power, it must be harnessed and refined for use. Vitalik and the Ethereum team laid out a plan for this refining process back in 2020. Rollups make the Ethereum blockchain more accessible in theory, but in practice building and operating your own chain is exceedingly complicated. To open up development in crypto and the next generation of applications, accessing onchain compute needs to be as easy and reliable as accessing compute in the cloud. We’re making that possible at Conduit. Conduit is the center for onchain compute. We deploy and operate modular rollups for apps and ecosystems of every size so they can access all the blockspace and throughput they need. With Conduit Deploy, teams can launch their own chain in a few clicks and trust it’s operated, maintained, and updated 24/7, 365 by Conduit’s RollOps team. Then we journey alongside our customers as they and crypto technology grow, establishing new standards together. We get that building onchain can still feel daunting. So we put experienced Web 2 infrastructure engineers alongside some of the earliest crypto contributors to bring cloud stability to crypto possibility. That’s how we can offer 99.999% uptime as well as day-one compatibility with the latest upgrades like Dencun. As projects scale, our RollOps team ensures their chains scale with them – all the while powered by optimal stack configurations customized to their needs. But all this reliability means nothing if people can’t access it. That’s why we brought product design and automation to crypto infrastructure. Conduit Deploy allows anyone from hackathon projects and startups to enterprise companies to start building on their own dedicated chain with no rollup expertise or code required. Here they can access Conduit-vetted frameworks, integrations, and scaling solutions all in one place. Even industry-leading teams with highly capable engineers like Zora, Aevo, and Mode entrust us to operate their rollups so that they can avoid spending time and money on undifferentiated development and instead focus on inventing new onchain applications. History has shown that most advanced tech pulls back and allows people’s experiences to take the lead. It’s time for crypto to advance. For infrastructure to release its grip on applications and for onchain compute to be immediately accessible on-demand. There’s been so much talk about what crypto will do for society. With Conduit, now the tech can finally step aside so app builders can build. About The Role In this role you'll be working closely with the CEO to architect, maintain, and scale backend systems at Conduit. You'll work across the stack on UI/UX, analytics, billing, CLIs, and anything else that needs to get built. As a Backend Engineer at Conduit, you will: Architect, build, and deploy the back-end systems, services, and APIs that power our infrastructure products. Implement product features like billing, metrics, permissioning, and more. Contribute to defining Conduit’s product strategy and roadmap with the rest of the team We think you’ll find this work really exciting if you: Have experience with web app technologies (http servers, databases, typescript, React, etc.). Like building general frameworks and infrastructure that could be used for many different features. Are excited about helping build robust infrastructure that enables crypto to scale. Our tech stack We use React, javascript/typescript, Go, postgres, and rust. While we value experience with these technologies, we are primarily looking for engineers with strong technical skills and the ability to quickly pick up new tools and frameworks.

        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role As a Core Product engineer, you will directly contribute to the foundational pieces of Notion's building blocks. You will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that allows Notion to achieve the connected workspace vision. Your work will include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing functionality to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization, has outsize impact on how fast Notion grows, and guides the full-stack direction. Moreover, you will be presented with challenging technical problems as Notion’s product needs are complex. You’ll also play a key role in identifying and executing against technical investments that ensure the long-term quality, reliability, and performance of databases in Notion as we scale. You will help define team norms, operating principles, team culture, and much more. What You'll Achieve You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more. You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions. You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems. Skills You'll Need To Bring Proven track record of execution: You have 7+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers. Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members. Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates. Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Nice To Haves You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres. You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The Optimized Checkout & Link team at Stripe builds best-in-class checkout experiences across web and mobile that delight consumers and streamline checkout flows for merchants. Based across North America, we're a diverse team who are deeply passionate about redefining the payment experience creating outstanding value for merchants, increasing revenue, lowering cost and growing their business. We work on Checkout, Payment Links, Elements, Payment Methods, and Link – each playing a crucial part in augmenting the economic landscape of the internet. Our days are filled with exciting challenges and collaborative problem-solving as we strive to simplify payment options, create unique business solutions and enhance checkout ease. Join us in crafting the future of digital commerce. What you’ll do As a full-stack engineer on the team, you’ll be responsible for shaping and building a suite of products that let our users model and operate their business more efficiently. We’re looking for engineers who are excited to build the future of hosted UIs, high-polish user experiences, and APIs. Full-stack engineers at Stripe bridge the gap between backend and frontend systems to solve technical challenges quickly and effectively. You will work on projects that span technologies, systems, and processes where you will design, build, test, and ship great code every day. In this cross functional role, you will collaborate with experts in infrastructure, security, design, and operations to build mission critical internal and external features that power Stripe users around the world. You Will Work with a wide range of systems, processes and technologies to own and solve problems from end-to-end. Work closely with engineers, designers, and product managers to build new features and products. Uphold our high engineering standards and bring consistency to the many codebases and processes you will encounter. Build elegant APIs and user experiences that enable merchants to run and scale their businesses on top of Stripe. Contribute to the design and architecture of the next generation of Stripe’s infrastructure, to meet the high growth needs of our company and customers for years to come. Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements 2+ years of professional experience in a software development role. You can work effectively across the stack from top to bottom, comfortably navigating codebases with different languages and tools. You’re equally as comfortable shipping user-facing experiences as you are writing custom queries to analyze experiment results. Preferred Qualifications Experience working in high-growth teams similar to Stripe. Experience building financial systems or tools for financial experts. Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $136,800 - $244,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

Entrepreneurial drive — You’re able to work without explicit direction and feel intense ownership over the products you create. As a founding member, you’ll be expected to thrive in ambiguity that comes with an early-stage startup and can get things done without overcomplicating the solution. Strong communicator — As an early-stage startup, there will be lots of changes and ambiguity in the beginning. You should be comfortable sharing your feedback early, and often, and you should be comfortable bringing up product ideas frequently.",

        "description": "Job Title: Full Stack Software Engineer Primary Location: Remote Position Type: Direct Hire Overview TalentFish is casting a line for a Full Stack Software Engineer. This is a remote dirent hire role. We are tech agonistic, and collectively choose the best tools for the job. We're constantly looking to maximise our productivity and minimize what we call \"discounted dev time cost for shipping features. We have 2 separate fully functional web apps in prod: one for clinical users and one for patients. Our stack is currently entirely in JS/TS: Angular + Capacitor + Electron, React (internal tools), Amplitude (analytics), a fully serverless backend in AWS (Cognito, Appsync GraphQL, Lambda, DynamoDB). We have good functional & unit test coverage and CI/CD. Our stack is in a great place already: highly scalable, cost effective, good test coverage, easily maintained, secure and perform with minimal to zero Ops. The product and codebase are stable and loved by our users. We write, test, deploy & ship new features rapidly. Strategically, we prioritize strong frontend-backend decoupling through GraphQL and strong modularisation of frontend and backend into hierarchical pure modules, with high abstraction internal services and helpers, allowing ephemeral lances (similar to 'squads') to work on functional modules without needing to understand or be overly concerned about other parts of the codebase. We're looking to add talented engineers who are hungry and understand the urgency and importance of what we're doing for society. First Month - Some Examples Of What To Expect Help add further key third party API integrations, including with legacy EMR systems and national APIs like e.g. the electronic prescribing service, allowing the company to directly issue prescriptions. Iterate on a proprietary graph traversal algorithm to improve patient care and clinical value, and increasingly move away from explicit curation to implicit curation by NNs. Ship important features that will directly increase delta lives saved in your first 2 weeks. Join customer calls to develop a deep understanding of their fundamental motivations and needs/pain points. Next 6 months - some examples of what to expect: Help architect and deploy a scalable & cost effective ETL data pipeline with version control, outputting clean data ready for tokenisation. Help deploy our active deep learning training & validation architecture to prod, so that we can correctly eat up our '1.0' systems at the right time Build cutting edge products like global context aware chat with semantic search, care orchestration and LLM-enabled cloud telephony e2e Hire/scale the team, while implementing the right processes at the right times to maximize discounted team productivity and minimize discounted dev time cost for shipping. 6+ months - some examples of what to expect: Potential to transition to a more managerial/executive role. Lead an autonomous lance of elite engineers to fix healthcare and save lives. Work with the Client/data team to creatively ideate and ship features to improve ETL pipeline throughput and quality through a data-driven approach powered by analytics. TalentFish is an employee-owned company pioneering a new realm in talent acquisition. We are redefining IT staffing by evolving AI, video screening, and our unique platform. TalentFish focuses on providing the best employee, consultant, and client experience possible. At TalentFish we are an Equal Opportunity Employer; we embrace and encourage diversity!",

Invest your talents in us, and we’ll return the compliment. Job Description Firmex, a Datasite company, is a global software-as-a-service provider. The company’s Firmex VDR service is the world’s most trusted virtual data room, having been used by over 140,000 companies worldwide to share confidential documents for due diligence, litigation and compliance.

Other cutting edge techs we use to customize our applications also includes: PowerShell, Ruby, Jenkins, Git, Ansible, Nginx, and more! As Our Full Stack Developer You Will Be involved in all aspects of new and exciting platform, component and UI builds. Build and integrate the component interface using HTML, JSON, RESTful API’s. Use technologies in ways that even the technology vendor has never even thought of! Constantly ask: is there a better way to do this? But someone who has the self-restraint to not implement change simply to be different. Apply their hands-on experience with ASP.NET/MVC type apps or ASP.NET/API or JavaScript in our development environment. Solve design and implementation issues in advance by using reliable code. Jump in on distributed systems and message passing to increase reliability. Understand asynchronous application behaviours of systems at scale.

A passion for Agile methodology but the flexibility to think outside the scrum. You can think on your feet, collaborate with your team and others, and you enjoy taking ownership for your work. A virtual toolbox that includes: C#, AWS, ASP.NET/MVC or API, SQL Server or Postgres, and modern JavaScript frameworks. A curious nature. You want to understand the process behind the decisions, the why of the design, and the nature of the application. New and shiny things can be fun but you’re interested in learning how new technologies, tools and methodologies would work for us. A desire to put your best foot forward. You want to be part of a team dedicated to creating and delivering quality software. Outstanding communication. This is not a heads-down role. You will be working with a team that innovates together, out loud. And you will need to listen, engage, and present to external teams and senior project managers in a confident manner. Pride. You enjoy your work and getting a job done well. You want to be part of a team that promotes their accomplishments and sees the difference they make.

We have capital and just completed a $6.5mm seed fundraise from Union Square Ventures, Abstract Ventures, and world-class angels to greatly expand the team. We are building a product developers love that enables AI agents to securely authenticate and operate across the internet, even when APIs don't exist. We are pursuing a massive TAM to be the identity layer for the next internet, where billions of agents are authenticated and managed via Anon. The culture We are technical and product-minded which enables us to build an epic product for developers, by developers. This makes being customer-centric easy. We like working with the latest tech and prefer testing out the most innovative projects and being curious early-adopters versus matching the status quo. We are hard-working and accountable and want to work with people that have a strong ownership-mentality when it comes to their work. We are fun and collaborative and mostly work IRL at our office in San Francisco. We also understand the need for \"deep work\" and have flexible hours and minimal meetings. About This Role Role overview Anon develops a set of APIs that power a suite of platform-specific client-side SDKs (e.g. mobile and desktop), as well as language-specific backend SDKs (e.g. Typescript and Python). As a backend engineer, you’ll work within a team to further development of these APIs as well as our backend SDKs, and collaborate with our business and product functions to help shape our product roadmap. You’ll be expected to engineer kubernetes clusters, network-level request manipulation & proxying, scalable browser runtime clusters, and even implement cryptographic protocols (on the horizon). You’ll directly shape the technical architecture of our developer toolkit. By collaborating closely with the CTO, you will define and implement key features, API interfaces, database schemas, and select tools and technologies that drive our engineering team. This role involves a high degree of technical skill, innovation, and ownership in backend development. Role responsibilities Design and maintain our APIs to ensure they are scalable, secure, and reliable. This includes designing interfaces, type systems, error models, database schemas, and authorization models. Contribute to our core SDK products by implementing new features and APIs, improving existing ones, and continuously refining the developer experience. Implement networking features like network traffic inspection and analysis, protocol-level request manipulation, and SOCKS5 + HTTP proxying. Develop and improve infrastructure capabilities including infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD using Pulumi, Flux, Tekton, Nix, and Cue. Ensure reliability and performance of our APIs by implementing test suites and telemetry to meet a high bar of quality. Manage releases of our SDKs and APIs through correct semantic versioning, crafting release notes, maintaining documentation, and updating sample projects. Write developer docs to facilitate seamless customer onboarding and write sample applications to demonstrate Anon’s functionality across its SDKs. Collaborate with internal teams including our design and frontend teams to align API, SDK, and infra development with company goals and client needs. Provide developer support to the customers integrating and utilizing our SDK, including addressing bugs, feature requests, and usability improvements. Stay up-to-date on the open-source universe including new frameworks, libraries, and tools that can be leveraged to improve our developer experience and product. Experience Required At least 1-3 years experience in developing SDKs, including all aspects from documentation to release management. Proficiency in backend service development (e.g. Typescript, Python, Rust, Go). Experience with API design across architectures such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC. Experience with maintaining versioned APIs and supporting backwards compatibility of SDKs. Experience with infrastructure management, Kubernetes, microservice architecture, and CI/CD. Familiarity with browser automation tools (e.g., Playwright, Puppeteer) and testing frameworks (e.g., Cypress, Vite). Familiarity with authentication and authorization protocols such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. Bonus points for experience with cryptography and cryptographic protocols. Bonus points for experience with low-level development of networking applications, including HTTP, TCP, and TLS. Bonus points if you have experience in building real-time streaming systems, preferably with WebRTC. Skills Required Strong skills in at least one backend language (Typescript, Python, Rust, or Go). Strong skills in self-learning and comprehending open-source code. Ability to function in a fast-paced environment where things change and you need to navigate ambiguity. Strong team player with excellent communication skills, able to work effectively with cross-functional teams. Ability and desire to work autonomously, solve problems, and learn new skills. Ability to go deep and research frameworks beyond their publicly available documentation. About The Benefits Benefits overview We believe that our team needs to be aligned with the business. For that reason, we intentionally keep our team small but elite and pay a competitive salary, offer generous equity upside, as well as standard benefits and a few unique ones. Specific benefits Competitive salary. Generous equity in the company. Standard health, dental, and vision benefits. Free gym membership at whatever gym you want to use. Company-provided work station setup of your choice. Fun and regular company-sponsored events, offsites, dinners, etc. Congrats on making it to the bottom of the application!

About Wealthfront Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built one of the first automated investment products that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee. We then expanded. We now work with partner banks to offer exceptional banking features through a Wealthfront Brokerage Cash Account, which makes it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $50 billion of our client’s hard earned money, pioneering the robo-advisor category and transforming the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions. Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to expand their horizon, and easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies, make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially in a way that’s transformational to their lives and their long-term future.

        "description": "Title: Web Developer Department: Creative and Marketing This role reports: Director of Creative and Marketing Location: Remote, but preference will be given to candidates based in Los Angeles, CA. Candidates must be based in a state where The Bail Project currently operates which includes the following: AZ, CA, CO, FL, GA, IN, IL, KY, MD, MO, MT, NY, NC, OH, OK, TX, PA, SC, WA About The Bail Project The Problem There is no place in the criminal justice system where money more clearly buys justice than bail. People who can’t afford bail remain in jail before trial, while those with money buy their liberty. Tying freedom to financial ability upends the presumption of innocence, tears lives apart, and perpetuates racial and economic disparities. It is also a key driver of mass incarceration. Each year, an estimated 2.5 million people sit in jail cells across America because they cannot afford bail. The Response The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to thousands of low-income people every year. We are on a mission to combat mass incarceration and demonstrate that a more humane, equitable, and effective pretrial system is possible. The Model The Bail Project uses a national revolving bail fund to pay bail for individuals who are legally presumed innocent, and whom a judge has deemed eligible for release. We then provide court reminders, transportation, and work with local partner organizations to connect our clients with voluntary social services and community-based programs. We call this model Community Release with Support, and it has proven highly effective in helping people make their court dates. As our clients’ cases close, bail comes back into the fund where it is recycled to help additional people. The goal of The Bail Project is to work ourselves out of a job by gathering human stories and data from our ground work to advance legislative and policy change to end cash bail and invest in Community Release with Support (aftercashbail.org). The Team We are a community of advocates committed to ending mass incarceration and advancing racial and economic justice. Our organization consists of a central support hub and a growing network of client advocates or “Bail Disruptors” who work in their local communities to provide bail assistance and help advance advocacy efforts on the ground.

        "description": "Middesk is the business identity platform. Our APIs allow B2B companies to access the information, insights, and documentation they need to onboard and transact with their customers. Our products help product, risk, and finance teams make informed regulatory compliance and commercial credit decisions, confirm that suppliers meet federal and state licensing requirements, and register their customers with the necessary government agencies. Our verification product allows platforms like Shopify, Affirm, and Wells Fargo to determine the legitimacy of any business in the United States and automate Know Your Business (KYB) requirements. In addition, our products can be used to identify a business's industry, sanctions risks, bankruptcies, financing liens, and active or pending litigations. Enterprises such as ServiceChannel and Tesla use our products to ensure that all of their suppliers are legitimate businesses registered with the necessary government agencies. Based in San Francisco and NYC, Middesk is backed by Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners, and Y Combinator. About Middesk Engineering We believe \"velocity\" is the rate at which we effect realized value for our customers, not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; how will this change I'm about to make help our customers get jobs done? When we’re coding, we're making hundreds of micro-decisions about user experience that add up. How can I communicate this exception to our customers in a manner that helps them understand what's happened and unblock themselves? Middesk Engineering is customer-first engineering. (check out our blog post on the topic). The role Engineers have the freedom to create a lot of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems. What You'll Do Work in React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and potentially Scala, Python, and Go to solve problems for our customers. Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend, backend, API, data processors, etc. Jam with Product Managers, Designers, Ops, and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products. Share your knowledge with others in Engineering; people should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you’re early in your career, you have something to teach. Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people, and good relationships matter. Help us interview and hire other Engineers. What You’ve Accomplished While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic, we’d love it if you had experience with a couple of the languages in our stack (see the first point above). We’ve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster. You’ve worked for a high-growth, venture-backed startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or, you've founded a company and are looking to get back into it. You’ve been working as a professional Software Engineer for at least three or more years. You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value, customer acquisition cost, and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you’ve done influences these metrics. Why you'll love it here Customer First: We stay energized by solving real customer problems and make each interaction meaningful and embrace the challenging path to help our customers succeed. Be an owner: We identify and tackle problems, take pride in our work, and measure impact. When we find an opportunity to improve the status quo, take it on! Act with urgency and purpose: We move quickly and simplify things as we go. We solve the problems that we have today in ways that allow us to move even faster in the future. Drive results together: We choose teamwork. We share our opinions, ask questions, understand where others are coming from, and move forward as a unified front. Embrace the journey: We dream big and are open to taking risks. Innovation happens through optimism, positivity, rigorous thinking, and hard work.",

        "description": "About Cylinder Founded in 2021 and offered as an employer benefit, Cylinder (formerly Vivante Health) delivers personalized, clinician-backed care to those suffering from digestive issues through its virtual health platform. Cylinder’s tech-forward, human-first program connects members to the right level of support at the right time through an easy interface, bringing the healthcare ecosystem together to align around member needs. Cylinder’s dedicated care teams help members proactively address their gut health from every angle – decreasing costs, reducing absenteeism, and improving their quality of life, at scale. Cylinder’s vision is to create a world where people receive convenient, personalized, and affordable access to the quality digestive healthcare they need to improve their overall health. Position Summary We're looking for an experienced, solution-focused software engineer to support frontend development of our web and mobile applications. You will have significant responsibility and influence in shaping those applications as we evolve our patient-centered experience in close collaboration with the rest of our product, design and software engineering teams. Our mobile apps are written in React Native w/ TypeScript. Our web application is written in React using Next and TypeScript. A significant percentage of JS code is shared across our Android, iOS and web platforms. The DevOps environment leverages a whole lot of GitHub and CodePush with various levels of automated testing for frequent releases to all clients. Expertise in these areas is a huge plus, but having familiarity with similar technologies can be fine substitutes. You will need to have a passion for quality and an ability to understand complex systems. Above all, you should be passionate about solving real world problems, and bringing that value to our members. Why is this a great opportunity for a senior software engineer? The problem domain and our approach to solving it is super compelling. We're bringing together data sources that have never been joined, building models of a GI patient that have never been built, and discovering new GI health insights that help real people to manage and support their real medical conditions. It's still early enough that there’s a lot of decisions and new discoveries to be made, so this is your chance to get in early and help shape our future. Other things about our environment you should be aware of: We're still a small company, which means that everyone still wears a lot of hats and we need engineers who are comfortable with ambiguity and working across a wide variety of challenges. That said, our existing engineering team has built an extremely efficient working environment based on best-in-class hosted SaaS frameworks that greatly minimize the overhead in deploying and supporting software in production. We're all really passionate about improving clinical outcomes for our members and truly advancing the GI health space. Most of us also have personal (direct/family/friend) connections to GI health problems. Whatever it is that fuels you, we're on a mission to build something much larger than ourselves here and looking for another partner in driving that mission forward. Responsibilities Include: Develop the kind of software that you’d want to inherit from another developer (documentation, test coverage, logging, metrics, etc.) Collaborate with the rest of your engineering team on design, planning and code reviews Partner with product stakeholders on ideation, feedback and refinement of solutions that meet our business needs Keep learning You'll be a good fit here if you are: A team player. You like collaborating closely with other engineers, often through pair programming, design & code reviews Empathetic to our members’ GI health conditions and are driven to improve their outcomes Security oriented. We take the stewardship of our customer's healthcare data seriously, and take no shortcuts to protect it Comfortable with a distributed workforce. We interact with each other via video chat, Slack and PR comments A self motivated, creative problem solver We are proud of the team culture that we foster today, which is extremely friendly and supportive while constantly reaching to raise our own standards of engineering. We're really excited about what we're building, and usually having fun building it together. If all of that sounds fun to you too, we'd love to meet you. Desired Qualifications Degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent experience 4+ years of demonstrated experience building and supporting software applications Proficiency with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React Native Ability to execute front end and mobile development throughout the entire development process. Driving continuous improvements from leveraging modern tools and frameworks that enables us to release more frequently. A passion for automated testing Outstanding communication and interpersonal abilities with colleagues, business partners, and vendors alike Bonus: Any experience with native iOS/Android code via Objective-C, Swift, Java or Kotlin Familiarity with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)/Firebase frameworks, such as Cloud Firestore, Cloud Identity, Dynamic Links, etc.. Experience with medical, healthcare and/or population health data. Double bonus for familiarity with FHIR and/or other healthcare data standards Experience working in a HIPAA regulated environment (or other regulated industry) and supporting data security and privacy controls Cylinder is an equal opportunity employer. We believe safe spaces where everyone can be their authentic selves is the key to a successful team so we welcome and embrace all identities, cultures, and backgrounds.",

        "description": "Padlet is building software for a good education. A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide. Exceptional products are exceptional in all dimensions that matter. Take the Dyson vacuum cleaner. Not only is it a good at vacuuming, it’s beautiful, feels good in the hand, is portable, and is easy to use. We are looking for Fullstack Engineers to build exceptional software products for a billion people. Responsibilities Owning and implementing new features that touch multiple layers of the tech stack. E.g. creating a beautiful search experience. Creating delight. E.g. through animations and micro UI. Making the web apps faster and more reliable. E.g. reducing javascript payload or making network requests more resilient. Improving how we work. E.g. improving our component library or tools we use to translate the web app into 40+ languages. Qualifications At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you write good code.” You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow. Bonus: you have a good sense of humor. About Padlet Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet. Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years. Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here. Tech stack Web: VueJS, Tailwind. Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python. Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake. Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.) Joys of engineering at Padlet We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow. A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting scale and concurrency problems. Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems. We like to craft delightful user experiences. They’re satisfying to build. We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them. We ship often. We value beautiful code. Sorrows of engineering at Padlet We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it! Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it! Some people you'd work with Josh Hewitt: insists that wallabies and kangaroos are different animals, artificially inflating the biodiversity of his homeland. Is excellent at surgically improving an existing, complicated system. Colin Teahan: lives for one-liners. E.g: Colleague: “Wouldn’t it be funny if Iron Man were anemic?” Teahan: “It would be IRONIC.” Single-handedly wrote early versions of our iOS and Android apps. The office Our office is in the middle of Presidio, a beautiful national park. We’re 5 minutes from the beach, a walk we take often. The WiFi works outdoors. You can work sitting in a lawn overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. The office itself is designed to be a space for all your interests and hobbies. We have a meditation room, game room, library, podcasting studio, art studio, kids room, and full makerspace with 3d printers, presses, laser cutters, sewing machines, and more. Benefits Top tier medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family. One Medical and Cue memberships for you and your family. 401(k) with matching. Commuter benefits. FSA. Good stock options. Catered lunches and dinners. 20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens. All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year. Special time to join Because we're small, there's a lot of energy. And because we have tremendous traction, your first commit touches millions. This combination is rare and quite satisfying.",

        "description": "Who We Are Nuro exists to better everyday life through robotics. Founded in 2016, Nuro is a leading autonomous technology company with vehicles on road today in California and Texas. The company’s core technology is the Nuro Driver, an integrated autonomous driving system consisting of state-of-the-art, AI-first software and custom-built sense and compute hardware. The first commercial application of the Nuro Driver is autonomous goods delivery with our custom, electric, zero-occupant vehicles in partnership with some of the most recognized brands in the world including Uber and FedEx. About The Team We are a team of passionate engineers who are committed to making a difference in the world. We are excited to work on challenging problems and to make a positive impact on the future of transportation. We will achieve this by: Identifying and addressing pain points in the engineering process. Creating new tools and infrastructure to improve efficiency. Educating engineers on best practices. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies to boost productivity. About The Work Collaborate with engineers across Nuro to identify pain points in the engineering process. Define, instrument, analyze, communicate, and monitor batch/stream metrics related to engineering velocity and system health. Creatively address day to day developer inefficiencies using the best methods available . This can mean making new internal tools, extending existing tools, or introducing new tools to the company. Build scalable infrastructure that continuously merges, builds, tests, and releases code while balancing coverage, speed, and cost. This is a challenging problem with no out of the box solution, especially due to the complexities of Nuro’s machine learning and hardware tests. Solving this requires employing state of the art techniques in areas like build optimization, intelligent test selection, and culprit finding. Own and improve fundamental libraries e.g. APIs/clients to interact with complex systems. This includes managing code dependencies (including third party libraries) and managing the structure of Nuro’s codebase. Educate developers on best practices and new tools. Leverage Generative AI to boost engineering productivity. About You Inefficiency bothers you. The thought of taking a frustrating process and making it elegant sounds appealing. You can flexibly build new tools end to end to address constantly changing developer needs. You are passionate about software engineering best practices. You know how to build scalable and reliable infrastructure pipelines. You are highly collaborative and care about creating the best possible user experience. You have strong software engineering skills in Python, C++ and/or Go. You hold a Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree in computer science, software engineering, a related field, and 3-4 years of relevant industry experience. At Nuro, your base pay is one part of your total compensation package. For this position, the reasonably expected base pay range is between $125,400 and $188,100 for the level at which this job has been scoped. Your base pay will depend on several factors, including your experience, qualifications, education, location, and skills. In the event that you are considered for a different level, a higher or lower pay range would apply. This position is also eligible for an annual performance bonus, equity, and a competitive benefits package.

If you’ve had any experience with structured LLM output, we’d love to chat. Tech Stack The primary tech stack is Node, TypeScript, React/NextJS, Postgres, Docker. For our integrations we support MySQL, Snowflake, Mongo, BigQuery and more. We don’t use these much internally, but our customers do so it’s helpful to know. On the LLM side, we interface with OpenAI, Mistral, Llama, and Anthropic, so users have the choice of model to run. Companies can use Omni via the cloud product, or a VPC deploy.

        "description": "What We're Doing WW Clinic/Sequence's mission is to make healthcare more accessible, more transparent, and friendlier. We're addressing America's most pressing chronic conditions, starting with obesity, which affects over 50% of adults. We Do This By Connecting patients with board-certified obesity specialists to provide the highest quality of care, as well as access to the most effective weight management medications available Assembling a team of health coaches to support our members in their journeys toward better health Building a community for our members to share their experiences and learn from each other about healthy lifestyle practices And of course, to tie these pieces together, we're writing software that creates a seamless experience for our members and healthcare partners alike. We believe that healthcare shouldn't feel like work — it should feel fun, friendly, and personal. Why now? When it comes to startups, being at the right place at the right time can dramatically shift the odds in your favor. So why now for WW Clinic/Sequence? The FDA recently approved an exceptionally effective compound, semaglutide, for use as a weight loss aid. Telehealth is going through unprecedented growth. McKinsey reports that \"[t]elehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.\" These tailwinds grant us the opportunity to build something incredibly valuable, while also leaving a lasting positive impact on the lives of our customers. The Day-to-day We're a full-stack Typescript shop, from our frontend (React) to our backend (Node) to our cloud infrastructure (CDK). This isomorphism makes it a breeze for our engineers to work everywhere across the stack on what they're most excited about and what will have the biggest impact. We do daily standups in which we go over our issues in Linear, hold demo lunches where we share what we've been working on, and spend a lot of time in Slack huddles. You’ll contribute to core parts of our application stack, ranging from our customer-facing web application to our internal systems for automating insurance processes. We enjoy working together and make frequent use of our office gong to celebrate milestones. Who You Are We care less about your resume, and more about your motivation and excitement to grow. We’re a lean team with very high expectations. You’ll have a great time if you’re an all-star performer who enjoys wearing many hats, pushing yourself to do a little better everyday, and having a lot of fun along the way. You'll be working in both the frontend and backend, interacting with databases, shipping maintainable code quickly, clearly communicating technical ideas to the team, and owning big pieces of our system. With that said, here are a few things that we hope will describe you: You have extensive experience building and shipping full-stack Typescript applications. You’re a strong communicator and can elegantly describe complex technical concepts with clear and precise language. You want work in an ultra-fast-paced early-stage startup environment. 💡 Not sure you meet 100% of our qualifications? Please apply anyway! Location We have an office in sunny San Francisco, right above the Montgomery BART station. We’re currently evaluating candidates who can be in the office at least 3 days a week.",

        "description": "Background At Finley, we believe that today’s most innovative companies deserve financial infrastructure that can move as quickly as they can. Startups in finance, real estate, and transportation rely on debt capital to extend loans, purchase homes, and finance vehicle fleets. But these new-school companies rely on old-school technology to manage their debt capital. Think months of legal coordination, countless versioned Excel files passed around via email, and weeks of follow-ups—all culminating in a 200-page credit agreement that only lawyers understand, even though the future of the business depends on complying with it. The inefficiency of this process can delay—and in some cases block—access to capital when it's needed most. It’s time for the next generation of financial infrastructure builders to rise to the challenge. Finley’s software helps startups streamline the debt capital raise and management process. That way, they can spend more time focusing on their customers and less time worrying about fundraising. The Role We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our Engineering team. As an early employee, you’ll be responsible for designing, building, and testing an entirely new category of capital markets software from the ground up. You’ll architect and build the infrastructure that helps fintechs around the world collectively manage billions of dollars. Just as importantly, you’ll help shape the engineering culture and trajectory of a seed-stage startup. We’re looking for 0 → 1 individuals who are comfortable with autonomy early on and also excited to help build structures that will scale their own impact over time. In other words, we’re looking for candidates who want to build a lasting company just as much as they want to build industry-changing software. We believe in finding the best technology for the job, and being disciplined with only adopting the tools that actually let us move faster, build more securely, and enable a higher quality of life. We hate inefficiency and embrace debate to constantly find ways to make our lives easier and products better. Our tech stack (see below) reflects that philosophy. Your Responsibilities You will be responsible for helping architect, build, and scale the first lender-borrower relationship platform for the debt capital markets. - You will work with the team to design, product manage, and test early features for the Finley system. - You will become an expert in information security, data engineering and API design in a heavily regulated space. - You will become an expert on structured finance (no worries, we’ll fill you in!) and the ways in which technology can bring standardization to a field accustomed to legacy solutions. - You will help grow the Finley team by helping interview job candidates, mentor new engineers, and document standard operating procedures. Our tech stack Backend : NodeJS + Express, Apollo Server, Typescript - Frontend : React + Hooks, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Client - Database : Postgres + Knex - Infrastructure and deploys : AWS, Docker, ECS, CDK, CodePipeline - Collaboration : Github, Papertrail, and Trello We're looking for Builders. You have experience building web applications for 3+ years and can scope and ship products independently. - Problem-solvers. You focus on delivering outcomes and prefer to use the right tool for the job, rather than building for building’s sake. (That said, getting excited about a modern tech stack built on Node.js, React, and AWS wouldn’t hurt. See above.) - Collaborators. You like collaborating with Business, Design, and Product functions in addition to other engineers, and you believe that the best solutions can only emerge when everyone has a seat at the table. - Systems thinkers. You enjoy the complexity of designing for a range of stakeholders (think borrowers, lenders, and banks) and source systems. You get excited about designing for the long-term. - Team-builders. You look forward to helping recruit, train, and mentor a team of engineers at Finley.",
