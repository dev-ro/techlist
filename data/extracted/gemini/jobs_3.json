        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions. As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion. What You'll Achieve You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area. You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions. You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!) Skills You'll Need To Bring You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is. You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R). You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations. You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness. You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet. You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. About The Role Notion's mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly expanding our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As a marketing data scientist, you will play a critical role in accelerating Notion's growth by building and improving how we measure the impact of all our marketing efforts, such as brand campaigns and community. You will work closely with our marketing and engineering teams to make effective spending decisions across our marketing channels, recommend the most effective messaging and creatives from experiment design and analyses, and explore new opportunities for growing Notion's user base and business. What You'll Achieve You will build models to optimize our marketing efforts to make sure our marketing spend has the best possible ROI. You will design, launch and analyze experiments to understand the incrementality of different messaging and creative campaigns. You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your knowledge of marketing channels and platforms, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's marketing strategy beyond the numbers. You will partner closely with all marketing teams to make critical decisions about where we invest our marketing efforts, understanding the impact of our business, defining key success metrics and core segmentations. You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!) Skills You'll Need To Bring You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with paid marketing teams and having expertise in analyzing brand campaigns. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate your findings and recommendations to your partner teams. You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights. You are an expert in SQL and at least one of scripting languages such as R/Python. You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the metrics and reporting you need don’t exist yet. You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. Nice To Haves You have worked at a fast-growing start-up. You have experience at a B2B SaaS company. You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Pave's salary range for this position $204,000—$276,000 USD Our Compensation Philosophy Pave’s compensation philosophy is to target the 75th percentile of the market for both cash and equity at your job level. This means that the “mid point” of every band at Pave is the 75th percentile of the broader market. Pave also has a merit-based philosophy when it comes to compensation increases. We run a performance cycle twice per year to evaluate employees’ performance.

The result is that high performers at Pave are paid above the 75th percentile of the market at large. Pave is committed to pay equity. If you get an offer from Pave, it will be based on your level as determined by your interview performance. And nothing else.

        "description": "We are one of the leading tech investment firms globally, with a track record of investing in some of the most valuable companies in the world. We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams. One of our portfolio companies is looking to hire a business-oriented data scientist to help accelerate their growth and product initiatives. They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week. While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup: Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination. Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working. Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions. Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).",

        "description": "About Glean We’re on a mission to make knowledge work faster and more humane. We believe that AI will fundamentally transform how people work. In the future, everyone will work in tandem with expert AI assistants who find knowledge, create and synthesize information, and execute work. These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work. We’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications. Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers who saw a need in the enterprise space for their technical depth and passion for AI. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same. We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others. Role Glean is building a world-class Data Organization composed of data science, applied science, data engineering and business intelligence groups.

This specific role will address one or more of the following business domains: Accelerating Glean’s adoption, expansion, and usage intensity across all the product surfaces and customer lifecycles by using data to identify, implement and measure the effectiveness of product-led user growth strategies. Build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the efficacy of generative AI products executing workflows on behalf of end users, instead of just answering questions and helping them find what they need. These workflows will range from simple to multi-step complex workflows, and will pave the way for AI Agent capabilities that will enable end-users to provide their needs in natural language and achieve those tasks via LLM-powered chain of autonomous execution. You will thrive at this role if You have a Bachelors/Masters/PhD degree in Statistics, Mathematics or Computer Science, or another quantitative field. You have 4+ years of industry experience (3+ for Masters degree holders, 2+ for PhD degree holders). You are concise and precise in written and verbal communication.

        "description": "Why join Pave? At Pave, our vision is simple - Make Compensation Fair. How are we going to get there? By building the most intelligent compensation platform, powered by the largest real-time compensation dataset on earth. We partner with our customers to help them build and retain world-class teams through planning, communicating and benchmarking their team’s compensation in real time. And you don’t have to just hear it from us — you can hear it from our customers: Hover, Plaid, Fanduel and more! We’re growing fast, building an incredible team and product, and having plenty of fun as we do it in our San Francisco and New York City offices. If operating with intellectual honesty, playing to win, and focusing on upholding a platinum standard sounds exciting - we highly encourage you to reach out. We’d love to partner on our journey to change the world of compensation! Data Science @ Pave Data is truly at the heart of what we do here at Pave. So, it’s no surprise that Pave Data Scientists are integral collaborators and strategic owners with company-wide impact. Our team members build data infrastructure, create and deploy ML models, define and evaluate metrics, and help create the tools our customers use to understand our unique data set. How you'll contribute: We’re looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our Market Data Team. The Market Data Teams prototypes and builds brand new data products, as well as leveraging data to improve our existing ones. You’ll partner with Product Managers and go-to-market leaders to understand user needs, partner with Design to create early prototypes and explorations, then work with our Software Engineering team to scale your insights into high quality, compelling user-facing products. The ideal fit for this role is someone who enjoys creating and innovating with data, is passionate about metrics and methods, and who is able to balance the need for technical complexity with user-facing simplicity. This person has a deep technical toolkit, but also knows that the highest value data products are not always the most complex. Required skills and experience: Have a Bachelors or other advanced degree in a quantitative discipline: statistics, operations research, social science, computer science, engineering, mathematics, economics, etc. 4+ years of experience in a Data Science role, preferably at a technology company. Expert data manipulation skills with a proficiency in SQL. Expert in statistical modeling with Python or R (e.g., clustering, regression, time series, Bayesian statistics). Strong data intuition and creativity: you are able to design creative, useful, and accurate metrics, and have strong intuitions about where metrics go wrong. Strong analytical problem solving skills: you have the ability to translate qualitative business questions into quantitative solutions. Product- and business-minded: you enjoy using data to solve user pain points and business problems. Strong ability to communicate technical outcomes to cross-functional audiences. Ability to navigate (and bring structure to) ambiguity, with the ability to bring a project from 0 to 1. Nice to haves: (But not required!) Experience evaluating the performance of ML models (not that this is not an ML-specific role, but you will work closely with ML Engineers). Experience with data transformations using dbt. Experience building customer-facing data products. Experience working with product managers, engineers, and/or designers. A final note — we highly encourage you to apply for this role, even if you don’t feel entirely qualified, or entirely sure. You never know! Compensation, It's What We Do. This salary range may include multiple levels. Your level is based on our assessment of your interview performance and experience, which you can always ask the hiring manager about to understand in more detail. Salary is just one component of Pave's total compensation package for employees. Your total rewards package at Pave will include equity, top-notch medical, dental and vision coverage, commuter benefits, catered lunch, an unlimited PTO policy, and many other region-specific benefits. Pave's salary range for this position $205,700—$278,300 USD Our Compensation Philosophy Pave’s compensation philosophy is to target the 75th percentile of the market for both cash and equity at your job level. This means that the “mid point” of every band at Pave is the 75th percentile of the broader market. Pave also has a merit-based philosophy when it comes to compensation increases. We run a performance cycle twice per year to evaluate employees’ performance. Higher than average performance ratings result in compensation increases to the upper end of the individual’s compensation range for their role. The result is that high performers at Pave are paid above the 75th percentile of the market at large. Pave is committed to pay equity. If you get an offer from Pave, it will be based on your level as determined by your interview performance. And nothing else. We explicitly do not negotiate salary and equity to ensure that we aren’t introducing bias that could lead to pay inequities within the team between candidates who have different negotiation tactics.

        "description": "Overview In this role, you’ll be embedded inside a vibrant team of data scientists. You’ll be expected to help conceive, code, and deploy data science models at scale using the latest industry tools. Important skills include data wrangling, feature engineering, developing models, and testing metrics. You can expect to... Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them “machine learning ready”. Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models. Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms. Run regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models. Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders. Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver. What you'll bring BS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience. Knowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark). Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering). How you will lead Model Prototyping: The ML Engineer would be expected to build prototype models alongside data scientists. This may involve data exploration, high-performance data processing, and machine learning algorithm exploration. The ML engineer will be expected to come up with a rationale for model choice and come up with metrics to properly evaluate models. Model Productionalization: Works with data scientists to productionalize prototype models to the point where it can be used by customers at scale. This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models. Model Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose. Machine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling.",

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams. A portfolio company is looking to hire machine learning engineers as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit. While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup: Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination. Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working. Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions. Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).",

        "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk. The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems. What you’ll do Responsibilities Designing, training, improving & launching models Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact Thrive in a collaborative environment Preferred Qualifications Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

        "description": "About Us At Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. The biggest challenge AI companies face today is actually not half as glamorous as the outside world may think: it's all about data quality. In fact, the success of any AI application today relies on the quality of a model's training data — and for 95% of teams, this essential step is both the most costly, and the most time-consuming, in getting their product to market. As ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt first-hand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building AI. AI today is what the early days of computing or the internet were like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are still primitive, preventing the next generation of applications. This is why we started Encord. We are a talented and ambitious team of 60, working at the cutting edge of multimodal and visual AI, backed by top investors, including CRV and Y Combinator, leading industry executives like Luc Vincent, former VP of AI at Meta, and other top Bay Area leaders in AI.

        "description": "What we’re building You generate enormous amounts of personal data when you use the internet. Every song you’ve ever listened to, every comment you’ve ever made on social media, and every purchase you’ve made – these and millions of other such “digital fingerprints” are actually stored somewhere online. Such data is extremely powerful and could make your life easier, better, and more magical. So why aren’t you using this data? Because there is no product today that effortlessly consolidates your data, and uses it to help you (without you being the product!). Not yet, anyway – meet Ario, the definitive personal assistant whom we’re building here at Ario. Ario will help you gather all of your data with a single click. With this deep context about your life, Ario will be able to proactively make your life easier – whether by acting as a memory aid, helping you stay on track with your goals, or anticipating your future needs. Ario will also happily help you do things, such as managing your calendar, communicating with your family and friends, and searching for flights and interesting events. What we’re looking for We’re seeking an entrepreneurial AI engineer to lead Ario’s efforts to develop Ario, the next-generation personal AI assistant. LLMs have certainly made it far easier to understand natural language, but they represent just the tip of the iceberg. LLMs are simply one of many tools in our AI engineering toolbox, and there is so much nuance (and so much more to learn, everyday!) when it comes to the art and science of designing and building intelligent AI systems. In our case, there is also a rich data science aspect: how do we create and compute relevant signals from our messy and noisy personal data, and enrich/transform it such that Ario is able to work with it? Who would be successful in this role In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to tackle the above challenges on a daily basis. We believe that to do so effectively, you’ll need to have a good sense of the rapidly changing field of generative AI – having tinkered with LLMs – and a strong foundation in AI and machine learning. You’ll also have a solid intuition for data, having personally wrangled many different kinds of data in the past. You should feel at ease keeping up to date with the latest research, and be able to creatively and iteratively apply relevant ideas to our designs, with the goal of shipping production code. And you won’t be doing this alone – you will collaborate with a diverse team of data scientists, software engineers, and designers. With that in mind, here is a short list of specific requirements: ● Bachelor’s degree or several years of experience in computer science or another quantitative field; a master’s degree is recommended ● Solid working knowledge of Python. Experience with SQL is a plus. ● Good understanding of statistics, as well as machine learning frameworks, techniques, systems and design paradigms. ● A love of problem solving, and of working with models and data of all kinds.

        "description": "Join a 3-month old startup and help build the next generation of AI developer tooling! In this role you will work closely with a startup founder (Fred Weitendorf https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederick-weitendorf-40b505b6/) creating a radically different way to develop APIs. You'll have the opportunity to work on a very wide variety of projects and technologies including IDE extensions, AWS and GCP container/function as a service products, vector search, RAG development, machine learning, testing, containerization, and build tooling. As an employee at an early stage startup, you'll be in a position to \"wear many hats\" and help with product management, UX research, competitive analysis, and technical documentation if the need arises and you wish to learn about these functions. If you're interested in founding a company yourself some day, or joining a startup after graduation, this is an excellent chance to see what a startup is like in its earliest stages. Even if you're just interested in software engineering, you'll be exposed to a much wider variety of technologies than you would in most software roles, and be able to work on cutting edge technology like RAG and multitenant cloud products. This is a fixed-term summer 2024 internship role available for undergrad, MS, and PhD students studying Computer Science and related fields. We're actively searching for office space in San Francisco (around FiDi/Soma), where candidates should be prepared to work full-time for 4 days a week, with one day a week remote. Before the office space is available, candidates should be prepared to meet in person in San Francisco for 2-3 hours per day, 3 days per week. Please let us know if you are not currently residing in the area and are interested in help with housing or relocation! About the hiring manager: Prior to starting a company in March 2024, Fred worked as a SWE at Microsoft on the Teams telemetry platform and a senior SWE at Google on Serverless Computing products. At Google, he led a team of engineers to completely take apart and rebuild Google Cloud Functions' dataplane for multitenancy for major performance and cost efficiency benefits, and directly hosted interns. Responsibilities Assist in the development of visual studio code extensions and related frontend projects, integrating with both first and third party cloud and LLM APIs. Assist in the design, implementation, and testing of a cloud platform product. Contribute to the development of remote testing, build, and containerization and software. Contribute to a project to train and tune LLMs for RAG. Research and evaluate third-party products and tools for integration into projects. Contribute to basic product management, UX research, competitive analysis, and technical documentation if desired. Qualifications Currently pursuing a bachelor's, master's, or Phd in Computer Science or a related field. (Preferred) Familiarity with one or more of the following areas: IDE extension development, cloud backend development, containerization, LLMs/RAG, devops, developer tooling. Experience in programming with languages like C++, Go, Python, or Java. Excellent and creative problem-solving skills. Strong written and verbal communication skills. Most importantly: motivated by a desire to learn, and excited to work closely with just 1-2 engineers in a scrappy startup. Why work here? This is an opportunity to gain and build experience in a cutting edge field. You will get to work with third-party LLMs and custom RAG development in the context of software engineering tooling, creating an entirely new kind of product. You will get to work closely with, and learn from, a startup founder with a rare background in mutli-tenant distributed systems, who led and shipped projects at the world's largest software companies. And you'll have a blast working in a scrappy San Francisco startup with big ambitions! We also offer: Hourly pay of $35-40/hr Housing and relocation assistance for those not local to the San Francisco Bay Area Networking and continuing education opportunities Lunch stipend when working from office NOTE: As this is a summer 2024 internship role, applicants should be prepared to start working in mid-late June. We are an equal opportunity employer. We encourage applications from candidates of all backgrounds.",

Carefully structured analyses and reproducible analytic pipelines accelerate ongoing efforts to gain clinically relevant insights. Our research efforts are at the intersection of cardiovascular disease and human genetics—including both somatic and germline variation. Our clinical research efforts employ new techniques for deep phenotyping, such as deep learning. But these techniques rely on a solid foundation of classical bioinformatics. The Bioinformatics Programmer/Data Scientist will assist in managing, cleaning, and analyzing large scale medical data using a wide variety of analytic techniques, both in the cloud and with on-premises compute depending on data permissions. Experience with a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud is a plus, and ability to learn how to manage cloud-based pipelines, and to perform cloud data management will be essential to learn. Maintaining bioinformatic databases by obtaining and restructuring data, including both UCSF proprietary data and public data, and writing tools to streamline discovery and replication analyses using these databases will be core responsibilities. An important task will be writing and maintaining analytic pipelines in languages such as R, python, Go, Rust, shell, SQL, WDL, and/or other appropriate languages, and using tools such as Docker. Experience with databases or the ability to learn will be requisite. Under the supervision of the PI, the Data Scientist will also be involved in data analysis, and will be comfortable with bioinformatic analyses including variant calling and annotation. There will be opportunities to employ cutting-edge methods and to develop new methods.
