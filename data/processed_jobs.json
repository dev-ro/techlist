This ground-breaking new internet layer opens up previously unimaginable possibilities for payments, commerce and markets that... can help raise global economic prosperity and enhance inclusion. Our infrastructure - including USDC, a blockchain-based dollar - helps businesses, institutions and developers harness these breakthroughs and capitalize on this major turning point in the evolution of money and technology.\n\nWhat you'll be part of:\n\nCircle is committed to visibility and stability in everything we do. As we grow as an organization, we're expanding into some of the world's strongest jurisdictions. Speed and efficiency are motivators for our success and our employees live by our company values: Multistakeholder, Mindfulness, Driven by Excellence and High Integrity. Circlers are consistently evolving in a remote world where strength in numbers fuels team success. We have built a flexible and diverse work environment where new ideas are encouraged and everyone is a stakeholder.\n\nWhat you'll be responsible for:\n\nAs our first Data Science hire focusing on Machine Learning at Circle, you'll start by focusing on two critical problems: helping identify transactions and actors who might be acting illicitly and helping us better balance our reserves across a series of accounts to reduce systemic risk inside the company. These problems are core to our identity as a safe and compliant actor in the crypto space and we are trying to come up with the best methods and techniques possible to solve these problems. In addition, we would like you to undertake additional research and work to help understand these problems, visualize what we're doing, as well as sometimes venture into other spaces to help understand how our business works. While the focus of this job will be machine learning applications, there are times where we need to use data science to solve other problems and machine learning is not the only or optimal option.\n\nWhat you'll work on:\n\n\u2022 Own development, improvement, and maintenance of the two problems described above: helping identify transactions and actors who might be acting illicitly and helping us better balance our reserves across a series of accounts to reduce systemic risk inside the company.
