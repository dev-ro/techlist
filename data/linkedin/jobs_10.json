        "description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About The Role Anthropic is working on frontier AI research that has the potential to transform how humans and machines interact. As we rapidly advance foundational LLMs, application security is paramount. In this role, you will apply security patterns built for high-risk environments to safeguard model weights as we scale new capabilities. Working closely with software engineers, you will institute controls around access, infrastructure, and data to proactively minimize risks from bad actors. This is an opportunity to join a team of experts building AI for social good, while advancing the frontier of safe and ethical AI development. Responsibilities Lead “shift left” security efforts to build security into the software development lifecycle. Conduct secure design reviews and threat modeling. Identify and prioritize risks, attack surfaces, and vulnerabilities. Perform security code reviews of source code changes and advise developers on remediating vulnerabilities and following secure coding practices. Manage Anthropic's vulnerability management program.

You may be a good fit if you: Have 5+ years of hands-on experience in application and infrastructure security, including securing cloud-based and containerized environments. Have empathy, collaboration skills, and a learning mindset to work cross-functionally with engineers of all levels to build security into the product life cycle. Can use creative and strategic thinking to reduce risk through secure design and simplicity, not just controls. Possess broad security knowledge to connect the dots across domains and identify holistic ways to lower the overall threat surface. Have the ability to distill complex security concepts into clear actions and drive consensus without direct authority. Have a proactive mindset to thread security throughout the product lifecycle through activities like threat modeling, secure code review, and education. Have strong grasp of offensive security to anticipate risks from an adversary's perspective, not just check compliance boxes. Have experience with modern application stacks, infrastructure, and security tools to implement pragmatic defenses. Are passionate for security fundamentals like least privilege, defense-in-depth, and eliminating complexity that could sub-linearly scale security through smart design. Strong candidates may also: Have hands-on technical expertise securing complex cloud environments and microservices architectures leveraging technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS / GCP. Have experience with offensive security techniques like vulnerability testing, pen testing, and red team exercises. Have familiarity with AI/ML security risks such as data poisoning, model extraction, adversarial examples, etc. and mitigations. Have experience building security tools, scripts, and automations.

Candidates need not have: 100% of the skills needed to perform the job Formal certifications or education credentials Annual Salary The expected salary range for this position is: $300,000 — $405,000 USD Logistics Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. Compensation and Benefits* Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates. Equity - For eligible roles , equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance. US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents. 401(k) plan with 4% matching. 22 weeks of paid parental leave.

The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

Integrity: We’re conscientious, intentional, and empathetic. Our words and actions align. That’s our character. Please don’t ask us to play another part, we’re poor actors.

Inquisitive: We remain students by failing openly and turning lessons into solutions. Unconventional: For us, life isn’t what happens outside of work. Work happens inside of life and our culture erases the line often dividing the two. Authentic: Made possible only because we embody the values listed above.

Design, develop, and deploy interactive data visualization solutions using the Dash and Plotly frameworks. Work closely with data scientists and analysts to turn complex datasets into intuitive and impactful visualizations. Design and develop robust and scalable dashboards using Dash Plotly framework for data visualization. Collaborate with data analysts and other stakeholders to understand user needs and deliver comprehensive visualization solutions. Implement and maintain database connectivity to ensure dynamic updating of visualizations. Optimize data processing and visualization code for maximum speed and scalability. Ensure cross-platform optimization for mobile and desktop. Maintain clear and coherent documentation, ensuring that all developments and modifications are fully traceable. Stay up-to-date with the latest applications and advancements in data visualization technologies. What we'd like you to have: Bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology, engineering, or a related field.
