This is a major step forward to go beyond episodic appointments to continuous care at home, and deliver interdisciplinary wraparound care in partnership with the patient’s existing local doctor. Salvo is backed by leading health care investors from innovators like Livongo, Ro, Ginger, Forward, Brightline, Tia, and others. Salvo care draws on expertise from Board-certified specialty physicians, registered dietitians, nurses, psychologists, and therapists who have developed our evidence-based protocols, for a personalized, multi-month journey to better health.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

Our platform is built on AWS, is serverless-first and consists of hundreds of Node.js microservices that run across thousands of AWS Lambda functions. With a loosely coupled architecture and aggressive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing coverage, each microservice is tied to a continuing integration & delivery pipeline that allows us to deploy to production dozens, sometimes hundreds, of times per day.

These microservices will add new features for our customers or integrate our platform with external systems using our partners' APIs.
