        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions. As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion. What You'll Achieve You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area. You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions. You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!) Skills You'll Need To Bring You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is. You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R). You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations. You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness. You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet. You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week. While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup: Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination. Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working. Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.

You’ll be expected to help conceive, code, and deploy data science models at scale using the latest industry tools. Important skills include data wrangling, feature engineering, developing models, and testing metrics. You can expect to... Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them “machine learning ready”. Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models. Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms. Run regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models. Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders. Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver. What you'll bring BS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience. Knowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark). Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering). How you will lead Model Prototyping: The ML Engineer would be expected to build prototype models alongside data scientists. This may involve data exploration, high-performance data processing, and machine learning algorithm exploration. The ML engineer will be expected to come up with a rationale for model choice and come up with metrics to properly evaluate models. Model Productionalization: Works with data scientists to productionalize prototype models to the point where it can be used by customers at scale. This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models. Model Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose. Machine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling.",

        "description": "About Us At Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. The biggest challenge AI companies face today is actually not half as glamorous as the outside world may think: it's all about data quality. In fact, the success of any AI application today relies on the quality of a model's training data — and for 95% of teams, this essential step is both the most costly, and the most time-consuming, in getting their product to market. As ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt first-hand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building AI. AI today is what the early days of computing or the internet were like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are still primitive, preventing the next generation of applications. This is why we started Encord. We are a talented and ambitious team of 60, working at the cutting edge of multimodal and visual AI, backed by top investors, including CRV and Y Combinator, leading industry executives like Luc Vincent, former VP of AI at Meta, and other top Bay Area leaders in AI.

        "description": "What we’re building You generate enormous amounts of personal data when you use the internet. Every song you’ve ever listened to, every comment you’ve ever made on social media, and every purchase you’ve made – these and millions of other such “digital fingerprints” are actually stored somewhere online. Such data is extremely powerful and could make your life easier, better, and more magical. So why aren’t you using this data? Because there is no product today that effortlessly consolidates your data, and uses it to help you (without you being the product!). Not yet, anyway – meet Ario, the definitive personal assistant whom we’re building here at Ario. Ario will help you gather all of your data with a single click. With this deep context about your life, Ario will be able to proactively make your life easier – whether by acting as a memory aid, helping you stay on track with your goals, or anticipating your future needs. Ario will also happily help you do things, such as managing your calendar, communicating with your family and friends, and searching for flights and interesting events. What we’re looking for We’re seeking an entrepreneurial AI engineer to lead Ario’s efforts to develop Ario, the next-generation personal AI assistant. LLMs have certainly made it far easier to understand natural language, but they represent just the tip of the iceberg. LLMs are simply one of many tools in our AI engineering toolbox, and there is so much nuance (and so much more to learn, everyday!) when it comes to the art and science of designing and building intelligent AI systems. In our case, there is also a rich data science aspect: how do we create and compute relevant signals from our messy and noisy personal data, and enrich/transform it such that Ario is able to work with it? Who would be successful in this role In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to tackle the above challenges on a daily basis. We believe that to do so effectively, you’ll need to have a good sense of the rapidly changing field of generative AI – having tinkered with LLMs – and a strong foundation in AI and machine learning. You’ll also have a solid intuition for data, having personally wrangled many different kinds of data in the past. You should feel at ease keeping up to date with the latest research, and be able to creatively and iteratively apply relevant ideas to our designs, with the goal of shipping production code. And you won’t be doing this alone – you will collaborate with a diverse team of data scientists, software engineers, and designers. With that in mind, here is a short list of specific requirements: ● Bachelor’s degree or several years of experience in computer science or another quantitative field; a master’s degree is recommended ● Solid working knowledge of Python. Experience with SQL is a plus. ● Good understanding of statistics, as well as machine learning frameworks, techniques, systems and design paradigms. ● A love of problem solving, and of working with models and data of all kinds. (Our team is called “Models And Data”, or “MAD” for short…) ● End-to-end experience designing, developing, deploying and measuring an AI system will be a strong plus. ● Experience with natural language processing (including but not limited to LLMs) will also be a strong plus. ● Excellent communication skills Why you should join us You’ll be joining a small and creative team of AI/ML engineers. We’re all builders and tinkerers at heart – we share lots of laughter as we hustle together, whether it is shipping the next big feature, playing with some crazy experiments or debugging some code. We’re pretty loud as a team (just ask the other folks at Ario), though we do maintain regular quiet hours so that we can hear ourselves think. We also extensively use the ~80 sq ft of whiteboard space in our room, since we are in-person five days a week. Join us at Ario, to make millions of lives better with personal data and AI.",

Experience in programming with languages like C++, Go, Python, or Java. Excellent and creative problem-solving skills. Strong written and verbal communication skills. Most importantly: motivated by a desire to learn, and excited to work closely with just 1-2 engineers in a scrappy startup. Why work here? This is an opportunity to gain and build experience in a cutting edge field. You will get to work with third-party LLMs and custom RAG development in the context of software engineering tooling, creating an entirely new kind of product. You will get to work closely with, and learn from, a startup founder with a rare background in mutli-tenant distributed systems, who led and shipped projects at the world's largest software companies. And you'll have a blast working in a scrappy San Francisco startup with big ambitions! We also offer: Hourly pay of $35-40/hr Housing and relocation assistance for those not local to the San Francisco Bay Area Networking and continuing education opportunities Lunch stipend when working from office NOTE: As this is a summer 2024 internship role, applicants should be prepared to start working in mid-late June.
