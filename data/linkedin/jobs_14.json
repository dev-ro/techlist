        "description": "The Aspen Group (TAG) is one of the largest and most trusted retail healthcare business support organizations in the U.S. and has supported over 20,000 healthcare professionals and team members at more than 1,300 health and wellness offices across 48 states in four distinct categories: dental care, urgent care, medical aesthetics, and animal health. Working in partnership with independent practice owners and clinicians, the team is united by a single purpose: to prove that healthcare can be better and smarter for everyone. TAG provides a comprehensive suite of centralized business support services that power the impact of five consumer-facing businesses: Aspen Dental, ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers, WellNow Urgent Care, Chapter Aesthetic Studio, and AZPetVet. Each brand has access to a deep community of experts, tools and resources to grow their practices, and an unwavering commitment to delivering high-quality consumer healthcare experiences at scale. Our continued growth has created an opportunity to join our team as a GRC Security Analyst. The governance, risk and compliance (GRC) security analyst is a highly respected, influential and in-demand role within the business. The position is responsible supporting the security direction of the business and elevating the company’s security posture. The GRC security analyst is expected to support the security strategy of the business within new and existing information system capabilities. Consequently, the position requires both an understanding of legacy systems, as well as new technologies and requirements. The GRC security analyst is also responsible for the planning and design of policies and maintenance. The ideal candidate is technical and possesses at least three years of experience in security, compliance, or risk management. The role oversees the business’ security requirements and obligations mandated by standards and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). In tandem with security leadership, the GRC security analyst consistently assesses and validates the assurance of the security program. As a primary point of contact for internal and external auditors, the GRC security analyst monitors progress and enforces resolution of outstanding issues that may lead to non-compliance or security threats to the business. As a key member of the security team, the GRC security analyst must focus on strong risk management and corporate resiliency, and not be driven solely by compliance.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. About The Role Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As our inaugural web analyst, you will play a pivotal role in boosting Notion's growth.

You have worked closely with CRO and SEO teams to optimize website performance at scale. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is. You are an expert in SQL and have experience with Excel. You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights. You have built clean data visualizations and dashboards before using modern business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker etc).

Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate. Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful. Diversity & Inclusion Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation). Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions. Compensation Range: $165K - $200K",

Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services. Getaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses. Did you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don’t need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case. Through carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%.
