About SV Camp: SV Camp is a technical bootcamp designed to bridge the gap between traditional academic education and the practical, real-world demands of the tech industry. The program recognizes a common issue faced by many graduates: the skills taught in universities, while valuable, often do not translate directly into the hands-on expertise that employers are looking for. As a result, even well-educated individuals may find it challenging to secure jobs in the competitive tech market. SV Camp aims to resolve this discrepancy by offering a curriculum that emphasizes real-life scenarios and projects, closely mirroring the tasks and challenges professionals face in the tech industry. This hands-on approach ensures that students not only learn theoretical concepts but also apply them in practical settings, thereby gaining the experience and skills that are immediately applicable to their careers. The bootcamp is likely to include components such as coding projects, team collaborations, and perhaps internships or mentorships with tech companies, providing a comprehensive education that covers both the technical skills and the soft skills (like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving) that are crucial in the workplace. By focusing on these areas, SV Camp aims to produce graduates who are not just knowledgeable, but also ready to contribute effectively in their roles from day one, making them highly attractive to potential employers.",

For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote. Loom Video Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: Loom Video Overview Join our expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. This is a great opportunity to get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking eager-to-learn future developers who want to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. What Will I Be Doing? Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale. You will not be writing code. This role is 100% RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and is not a traditional software engineer role. Attention to detail, reading documentation, and being able to fully explain your reasoning when comparing code samples is essential. Pay Rates US Based: $30 USD/hr Non-US Based: $20 USD/hr for most countries (see full breakdown here) Opportunity to Advance to Tier 3: Tier 3 roles pay significantly more: $50 USD/hr for US-based developers and $35 USD/hr in most other countries (see full breakdown here). Tier 3 positions are awarded based on the availability of Tier 3 projects and your performance in Tier 2 tasks. Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want. You'll get paid on a weekly basis per hour of work done on the platform. Contract Length The contract is long-term with no end date. You can end the contract at any time. Our hope is that you would commit to 6 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand. Flexible Schedules You are expected to work 15+ hours a week with the ability to work 40+ hours. Developers can set their own hours. Take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours. Interview Process Apply using this Ashby form. If you look like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and needs to be finished within 72 hours of us sending it. You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll set up a group call to answer further questions about onboarding with the company. You'll perform a simulated production-level RLHF task on the platform. This will be your final interview and will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Required Qualifications 2+ years of professional software development experience in Python Complete fluency in the English language Ability to articulate complex technical concepts clearly and engagingly Excellent attention to detail and ability to maintain consistency in writing We look forward to receiving your application!",
