Scilex Holding Company may post different minimum wage ranges for permanent residency petitions pursuant to US Department of Labor requirements. Scilex Holding Company is committed to equal employment opportunities, and a workplace that embraces diversity and inclusion for qualified individuals of all backgrounds. About Scilex SCILEX HOLDING COMPANY (Nasdaq: SCLX, “Scilex”), is an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. We are uncompromising in our focus to become the global pain management leader committed to social, environmental, economic, and ethical principles to responsibly develop pharmaceutical products to maximize quality of life. The company’s lead product ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system) 1.8%, is a marketed prescription lidocaine topical product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the relief of pain associated with Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), which is a form of post-shingles nerve pain. ZTlido® possesses novel delivery and adhesion technology designed to address many of the limitations of current prescription lidocaine patches by providing significantly improved adhesion and continuous pain relief throughout the 12-hour administration period. Click here for ZTLido’s Important Safety Information and US Prescribing Information. We have acquired two FDA approved non-opioid pain products, GLOPERBA and ELYXYBTM, for the treatment of gout in adults and oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults. We launched ELYXYBTM in the U.S. in April 2023 and are planning to commercialize GLOPERBA in 2024. Our three product candidates are (i) SP-102 (10 mg, dexamethasone sodium phosphate viscous gel) (“SEMDEXATM”), a Phase 3, novel, viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid for epidural injections to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica and has received Fast Track Status from the FDA. Currently there is no FDA approved non-opioid epidural injection to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica; (ii) SP-103 (lidocaine topical system) 5.4%, (“SP-103”), a Phase 2, next-generation, triple-strength formulation of ZTlido, for the treatment of low back pain (“LBP”) and has received Fast Track Status from the FDA; and (iii) SP-104 (4.5 mg, low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules) (“SP-104”), a novel low-dose delayed-release naltrexone hydrochloride being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia. If these product candidates are approved by the FDA, we believe each of them could become the treatment option for their respective indications in the United States.

These one- to three-year fellowships are competitive and are designed to advance NASA’s missions in space science, Earth science, aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, and astrobiology. Description: The successful post-doc will participate in a program which focuses on understanding the Martian atmosphere, its variability, and its interaction with the surface through observing and/or modeling its primary traceable constituents, water vapor, water-ice and dust, and observing or modeling related surface features. The post-doc will be expected to analyze and synthesize data from Mars orbiters and landers and/or conduct relevant modeling studies. The primary goals of this program include gaining insight into (1) the character of and changes in the atmosphere on diurnal, seasonal, interannual, and longer timescales, (2) the current climate regime, its history and evolution, and (3) the nature of the water cycle and its relationship to long term sources and sinks. Thus, the post-doc would likely conduct a combination of modeling studies and data analyses, possibly including modeling climate evolution. Any modeling studies would be constrained by and validated against appropriate existing data that the post-doc would analyze. Data analysis projects would be used to examine and compare data sets to search for trends and differences spatially and temporally. Examples of recent work: Tamppari, L. K., and M. T. Lemmon, 2020.

BI/Reporting concepts Cloud technologies or NoSQL databases Client Interview Feedback For Your Reference Candidate: 1 He has no exposure or hands-on experience with Data Mart and Data Warehouse (DWH) projects. He was unable to explain basic DWH and Data Mart concepts using real-time examples from his projects. It appears that he has primarily worked on data migration projects. His SQL skills are weak. He struggled with writing queries using basic SQL clauses. He mentioned that before joining BNY Mellon, he did not use SQL extensively and had minimal exposure to it. He also stated that he began learning and working with SQL at BNY Mellon. His data analysis skills are below average. His data profiling skills are passable, but not strong. He has always worked with deliverables that have a monthly release cadence, not biweekly or weekly. I don't believe he will be able to handle deliverables at Jefferies' pace. He has no exposure to any Cloud technologies or NoSQL databases, which are key components of our upcoming tech stack in Reporting and a crucial tech stack in MDP. He has no exposure to Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs). Lacks IB & CM domain experience as well Candidate: 2 His relevant Tech BA experience is only 3.5 years. Additionally, he could not provide information about any other tools except Jira or elaborate on his roles and responsibilities as a Tech BA. He Is not a fit with Jefferies' work environment and culture. He is very passive, lacks enthusiasm, and could potentially disengage others within a few minutes. He has never played a lead role. He won’t be able to handle business stakeholders and delivery timelines He speaks at a very high level and was unable to share details despite my attempts to dig deeper. Although he mentioned using Azure, he could not name even a single Azure service. He could not use a simple example to explain DataMart. He lacks depth in basic SQL and could not perform basic joins. Candidate: 3 She doesn't understand what a Data Mart, dimensions, and measures are. She has never worked with Data Mart or Data Warehouse projects, or any other data-intensive projects. Her SQL skills are very weak. For sorting records, she used the GROUP BY clause and could not use basic functions like MIN(), MAX(), and GROUP BY clauses. For BI Reporting projects, she mentioned that she worked as a Scrum Master, not a Business Analyst, and so she does not have hands-on experience there as well.",
