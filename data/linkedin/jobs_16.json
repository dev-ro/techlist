Program And Job Description The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is expanding home visiting in NYC and streamlining how providers, organizations, and community residents can access quality home-visiting services.

Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities create disparate outcomes in certain neighborhoods as compared with the rest of the city, and providing services beginning in the prenatal through postpartum period is vital to improving these outcomes. In addition, recent attention to inequities in maternal morbidity and mortality, especially in New York City, points to the need for more respectful maternity care and greater agency for people during childbirth, both of which the program's staff will facilitate, in partnership with NYC doula organizations.

With the rapid growth of renewable energy this infrastructure footprint is expected to more than double in the coming years creating more assets to defend than ever before. Treeswift’s mission is to deliver effective scalable technology to manage the landscapes around large-scale distributed infrastructure, such as power lines. We do so by innovating across the technical stack. Data is collected by our sensor packs mounted on backpacks and vehicles to seamlessly integrate into customer operations.
