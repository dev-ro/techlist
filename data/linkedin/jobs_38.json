We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

The SupplyPike Company Pillars Are Curiosity: We constantly challenge prevailing thought by first seeking to understand the problem domain, strategy, market, and technology. We know that innate curiosity is crucial for building better, customer-driven products.

We favor openness, transparency, and joining forces with the talented people around you. Agility: We want to give our customers what they need to succeed. We understand that building a product (even an MVP) isn't worth the investment if the customer need is not validated. Iterating quickly and testing hypotheses with real customers as soon as possible drives our building stages. We avoid analysis paralysis by embracing that \"perfect is the enemy of good.\" Integrity: In layman's terms - don't make stuff up. We favor well researched knowledge over impromptu answers. This comes with a need for humility to understand the limits of our own knowledge. We understand making mistakes is a natural part of the process. Reflecting upon and learning from those mistakes is how we continue to grow. Empathy: We strive for an environment where being empathetic and considerate for the concerns of others is always top of mind. We take a 'no blame' approach by speaking with frankness about problems and solutions, but always avoiding personal attacks. Rudeness and condescension are kept at bay. Play: Changing an entire industry is hard work. We take our work seriously but never ourselves. We see problems as exciting puzzles; we see people as the invaluable contributors to the SupplyPike spirit. We embrace creativity, experimentation, and engagement, all while never compromising on the human experience and authenticity. Determination: Challenges and setbacks are a given. We see them as opportunities to learn, drive innovation, and continuously improve. We embody an unwavering commitment to achieving ambitious goals and overcoming challenges. We thrive in the face of adversity, constantly seek improvement, and refuse to settle for mediocrity.

Our stack made up of our Contextual AI Engine, Connector APIs, and Human Adaptive Feedback enable global organizations to adopt a true AI translation strategy, focusing on business outcomes instead of outputs. With Lilt, innovative, category-defining organizations like Intel, ASICS, WalkMe, and Canva are using AI technology to deliver multilingual, digital customer experiences at scale. As a result, Lilt’s AI technology foundation is similar to ChatGPT and Google Translate, before our patented Contextual AI Engine, connector-first approach, and human-adapted feedback. Our team is located globally in San Francisco, Indianapolis, London, and Berlin with hubs located in Washington D.C., New York City, and Boston. You can learn more about us and what it’s like to work here on our Careers page! This position can be based out of our Washington D.C. & Boston metropolitan areas where you will start as fully remote and then transition to hybrid once offices are opened in those locations. Fully remote applicants will also be considered. Authorization to work in the U.S. is a precondition of employment. The Engineering Team at Lilt Lilt is a high-performance, large-scale language translation system. We invest in and prioritize workflow (i.e., usability and interface design) and backend AI systems. Since the translation workforce is distributed worldwide, there are interesting cloud engineering problems to solve. We have a strong preference for building our own backend technology, so you’ll be implementing and working with the latest natural language processing (NLP) techniques and ideas. What You’ll Do Lilt is seeking a world-class devops engineer to build highly reliable software systems at Lilt. Your job will be to apply your software talents to our infrastructure and operations needs, including bare-metal Linux deployments and commercial deployments in GCP and AWS. Our system requires low latency worldwide, so you’ll continuously improve our multi-region configuration, and help us expand into new regions. You will collaborate with the rest of the engineering team to support new and on-going products. The person in this role may have technical leadership responsibility depending of experience and will collaborate to build the roadmap of the DevOps organization. Key Responsibilities Support technical operations in our development and production systems Deliver infrastructure engineering projects to support company initiatives Collaborate with our research and development teams to deliver software fast and reliably Secure our platform infrastructure and harden our on-premise builds Ensure high uptime and fast, multi-regional server and DB performance for the lilt.com production system Work with engineering teams to set, measure, and reach SLIs and SLOs for SLAs Contribute to infrastructure and engineering roadmap planning, set and attain quarterly OKRs Execute on the roadmap in sprints, and adhere to SCRUM best practices Introduce and implement new technologies and best practices in InfoSec, DevOps and Site Reliability Support our self-managed customers on-site Technically lead a group of subject-matter experts Skills And Experience Minimum 6 years experience as Linux System Administrator, DevOps Engineer or similar position.

Expertise in monitoring/alerting and maintaining high production availability Experience with CI/CD tools and concepts, such as Jenkins Preferred, but not required: Experience in DevSecOps best practices, MLOps, GCP Landzone and/or DB administration Our Story Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt. At its core, Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation. Benefits Compensation: Competitive salary, meaningful equity, 401(k) matching, and flexible time off plus company holidays. Medical Benefits: Employees receive coverage of medical, dental, and vision insurance, plus FSA/DFSA, HSA, and Commuter benefits.
