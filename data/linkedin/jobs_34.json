We have a bias for action. Speed is our biggest advantage. When forced to choose between breadth versus depth, we narrow the focus and increase the quality to maintain the speed. There is no middle ground between ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúfailure‚Äù for our customers. We are committed to ensuring our customers succeed and hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards.

We perform as a team, while encouraging independent thought and rigorous debate. Whenever possible, we play the long game. When needed, we will sacrifice short-term results that are in the long-term interest of the company. Diversity is part of our foundation - our entire industry relies on groups of people from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds coming together to coordinate a single commercial transaction.

Our Engineering And Design Principles Are Dream in Years Plan in Months Evaluate in Weeks Ship Daily Prototype for 1x Build for 10x Engineer for 100x What is required to cut the timeline in half for this deliverable? What needs to be done to double the impact? How does what I‚Äôm building address a specific need or solve a specific problem for our customers? What can I do to ensure my knowledge can be shared in a timely, efficient, and clear manner? Competencies We Prioritize For This Role Execution mindset: You move quickly and take a forceful stand without being overly abrasive Persistence: You demonstrate tenacity and a willingness to go the distance to get something done Intelligence: You learn quickly and demonstrate the ability to quickly and proficiently understand and absorb new information High standards: You expect personal performance and team performance to be nothing short of the best Work ethic: You possess a strong willingness to work hard and sometimes long hours to get the job done; you have a track record of working hard Attention to detail: You do not let important details slip through the cracks or derail a project Flexibility / adaptability: You adjust quickly to changing priorities and conditions; you can effectively manage through complexity and change; relentless resourcefulness is a must-have Proactivity: You act without being told what to do, while bringing new ideas to Petrichor Questions You Should Ask Yourself Am I comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a high degree of ambiguity and risk? Do I see myself as someone who will do whatever it takes to accomplish the mission, even if that includes tedious work? Do I want to work hard in a role that requires some nights and weekends at a company that would never be described as easy? Would I enjoy working in a company that prioritizes analyzing the inputs (the quality of my work) and outcomes (what results I achieved) before focusing on the outputs (the number of hours I worked)? Am I comfortable with owning my own career outcomes as opposed to a heavily defined scope and progression? Do I enjoy taking progressively larger amounts of responsibility and like rising to the challenge when needed? Would I do well in an environment where autonomy and being a self-starter is expected? How do I respond to quality and performance standards that many people might consider unreasonably high? Am I willing to dig into the details to make sure I sufficiently understand a problem or task at all levels? Can I communicate and deliberate with conviction but also be capable of changing my mind when presented with data or information that challenges my beliefs? Once a decision is made, can I fully and wholly commit to it?",

Today, hundreds of business teams use Acho to transform their processes and unlock more value from their data than ever before. Team Acho is engineering-focused and collaborative. Recently closed a Seed Round by Y Combinator, VCs, and industry leaders, we are setting off to solve some of the hardest problems in the data space today. As an engineer, you'll work on a variety of interesting products and problems for our customers. You'll generate great product ideas, as well as architect, implement, and release them. We love engineers owning projects, from start to finish. For example, new features often start off as customer ideas. So it could be your responsibility to talk to the customer and scope out what a solution might look like, in addition to actually building it, testing it, documenting it, and releasing iterating on it with the customer. üí† Qualification BS or Master degree in Computer Science 1-3 years of experience in Frontend Development You are passionate about technology and thrive in a dynamic environment with a focus on creative innovation over absolute perfection Architecting, building, and maintaining web applications Proficient in modern web client-side technologies and frameworks (Experience with Vue.js or React.js is preferred) Excellent communication skills in verbal and written English üõ†Ô∏è Necessary Skills HTML, CSS, and Javascript Modern JavaScript Framework (Experience with Vue.js is preferred) Experience with SSR SEO Optimization Webpack API Design Database (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) üåé Website https://acho.io/?=bookface ‚ùì FAQ What does the interview process look like? - We‚Äôll reach out for an intro call after reviewing your resume. We may follow by scheduling a technical interview. If the tech round went well, we‚Äôd give you a small project. After assessing the project, we‚Äôd be ready and make an offer. Can I work remotely? - Yes. We support a hybrid of remote and on-site work environments. What‚Äôs it like working for a startup? - Being a small nimble team is the best way to grow fast both personally and collectively as a team. We tend to debunk some of the stereotypes about working at a startup. We rarely work overtime. Our processes are pretty clear and structured. Our goal is super defined. Our financial risk is actually a lot lower than a lot of established businesses as we have zero debt, fewer commitments/overheads, and actually grow each month. What can I expect in terms of compensation? - We aim to compensate competitively. Additionally, we ensure a ‚Äúhappy rate‚Äù and boost in pay for every milestone we achieve together. What‚Äôs unique about this role? - The Front-end will work closely with our product designer and ship amazing features that delight users.

The world as we understand it is a big puzzle with tons of problems to be solved. The bigger our goal is, the more and harder the problems become.

        "description": "Conduit ‚Äì The Onchain Compute Company Blockchains are not only decentralized ledgers but raw sources of computing power. Like any source of raw power, it must be harnessed and refined for use. Vitalik and the Ethereum team laid out a plan for this refining process back in 2020. Rollups make the Ethereum blockchain more accessible in theory, but in practice building and operating your own chain is exceedingly complicated. To open up development in crypto and the next generation of applications, accessing onchain compute needs to be as easy and reliable as accessing compute in the cloud. We‚Äôre making that possible at Conduit. Conduit is the center for onchain compute. We deploy and operate modular rollups for apps and ecosystems of every size so they can access all the blockspace and throughput they need. With Conduit Deploy, teams can launch their own chain in a few clicks and trust it‚Äôs operated, maintained, and updated 24/7, 365 by Conduit‚Äôs RollOps team. Then we journey alongside our customers as they and crypto technology grow, establishing new standards together. We get that building onchain can still feel daunting. So we put experienced Web 2 infrastructure engineers alongside some of the earliest crypto contributors to bring cloud stability to crypto possibility. That‚Äôs how we can offer 99.999% uptime as well as day-one compatibility with the latest upgrades like Dencun. As projects scale, our RollOps team ensures their chains scale with them ‚Äì all the while powered by optimal stack configurations customized to their needs. But all this reliability means nothing if people can‚Äôt access it. That‚Äôs why we brought product design and automation to crypto infrastructure. Conduit Deploy allows anyone from hackathon projects and startups to enterprise companies to start building on their own dedicated chain with no rollup expertise or code required. Here they can access Conduit-vetted frameworks, integrations, and scaling solutions all in one place. Even industry-leading teams with highly capable engineers like Zora, Aevo, and Mode entrust us to operate their rollups so that they can avoid spending time and money on undifferentiated development and instead focus on inventing new onchain applications. History has shown that most advanced tech pulls back and allows people‚Äôs experiences to take the lead. It‚Äôs time for crypto to advance. For infrastructure to release its grip on applications and for onchain compute to be immediately accessible on-demand. There‚Äôs been so much talk about what crypto will do for society. With Conduit, now the tech can finally step aside so app builders can build. About The Role In this role you'll be working closely with the CEO to architect, maintain, and scale backend systems at Conduit. You'll work across the stack on UI/UX, analytics, billing, CLIs, and anything else that needs to get built. As a Backend Engineer at Conduit, you will: Architect, build, and deploy the back-end systems, services, and APIs that power our infrastructure products. Implement product features like billing, metrics, permissioning, and more. Contribute to defining Conduit‚Äôs product strategy and roadmap with the rest of the team We think you‚Äôll find this work really exciting if you: Have experience with web app technologies (http servers, databases, typescript, React, etc.). Like building general frameworks and infrastructure that could be used for many different features. Are excited about helping build robust infrastructure that enables crypto to scale. Our tech stack We use React, javascript/typescript, Go, postgres, and rust. While we value experience with these technologies, we are primarily looking for engineers with strong technical skills and the ability to quickly pick up new tools and frameworks. Conduit does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, non-disqualifying physical or mental disability, national origin, veteran status or any other basis covered by appropriate law.",

        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role As a Core Product engineer, you will directly contribute to the foundational pieces of Notion's building blocks. You will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that allows Notion to achieve the connected workspace vision. Your work will include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing functionality to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization, has outsize impact on how fast Notion grows, and guides the full-stack direction. Moreover, you will be presented with challenging technical problems as Notion‚Äôs product needs are complex. You‚Äôll also play a key role in identifying and executing against technical investments that ensure the long-term quality, reliability, and performance of databases in Notion as we scale. You will help define team norms, operating principles, team culture, and much more. What You'll Achieve You‚Äôll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. You‚Äôll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion‚Äôs building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more. You‚Äôll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions. You‚Äôll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems. Skills You'll Need To Bring Proven track record of execution: You have 7+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers. Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members. Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates. Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you‚Äôre building. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Nice To Haves You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres. You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals‚Äô strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others‚Äîand understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you‚Äôre excited about a role but your past experience doesn‚Äôt align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Millions of companies‚Äîfrom the world‚Äôs largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups‚Äîuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone‚Äôs reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team The Optimized Checkout & Link team at Stripe builds best-in-class checkout experiences across web and mobile that delight consumers and streamline checkout flows for merchants. Based across North America, we're a diverse team who are deeply passionate about redefining the payment experience creating outstanding value for merchants, increasing revenue, lowering cost and growing their business. We work on Checkout, Payment Links, Elements, Payment Methods, and Link ‚Äì each playing a crucial part in augmenting the economic landscape of the internet. Our days are filled with exciting challenges and collaborative problem-solving as we strive to simplify payment options, create unique business solutions and enhance checkout ease. Join us in crafting the future of digital commerce. What you‚Äôll do As a full-stack engineer on the team, you‚Äôll be responsible for shaping and building a suite of products that let our users model and operate their business more efficiently. We‚Äôre looking for engineers who are excited to build the future of hosted UIs, high-polish user experiences, and APIs. Full-stack engineers at Stripe bridge the gap between backend and frontend systems to solve technical challenges quickly and effectively. You will work on projects that span technologies, systems, and processes where you will design, build, test, and ship great code every day. In this cross functional role, you will collaborate with experts in infrastructure, security, design, and operations to build mission critical internal and external features that power Stripe users around the world. You Will Work with a wide range of systems, processes and technologies to own and solve problems from end-to-end. Work closely with engineers, designers, and product managers to build new features and products. Uphold our high engineering standards and bring consistency to the many codebases and processes you will encounter. Build elegant APIs and user experiences that enable merchants to run and scale their businesses on top of Stripe. Contribute to the design and architecture of the next generation of Stripe‚Äôs infrastructure, to meet the high growth needs of our company and customers for years to come. Who you are We‚Äôre looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements 2+ years of professional experience in a software development role. You can work effectively across the stack from top to bottom, comfortably navigating codebases with different languages and tools. You‚Äôre equally as comfortable shipping user-facing experiences as you are writing custom queries to analyze experiment results. Preferred Qualifications Experience working in high-growth teams similar to Stripe. Experience building financial systems or tools for financial experts. Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $136,800 - $244,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role‚Äôs On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate‚Äôs experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

This is a remote dirent hire role. We are tech agonistic, and collectively choose the best tools for the job. We're constantly looking to maximise our productivity and minimize what we call \"discounted dev time cost for shipping features. We have 2 separate fully functional web apps in prod: one for clinical users and one for patients. Our stack is currently entirely in JS/TS: Angular + Capacitor + Electron, React (internal tools), Amplitude (analytics), a fully serverless backend in AWS (Cognito, Appsync GraphQL, Lambda, DynamoDB). We have good functional & unit test coverage and CI/CD. Our stack is in a great place already: highly scalable, cost effective, good test coverage, easily maintained, secure and perform with minimal to zero Ops. The product and codebase are stable and loved by our users. We write, test, deploy & ship new features rapidly. Strategically, we prioritize strong frontend-backend decoupling through GraphQL and strong modularisation of frontend and backend into hierarchical pure modules, with high abstraction internal services and helpers, allowing ephemeral lances (similar to 'squads') to work on functional modules without needing to understand or be overly concerned about other parts of the codebase. We're looking to add talented engineers who are hungry and understand the urgency and importance of what we're doing for society. First Month - Some Examples Of What To Expect Help add further key third party API integrations, including with legacy EMR systems and national APIs like e.g. the electronic prescribing service, allowing the company to directly issue prescriptions. Iterate on a proprietary graph traversal algorithm to improve patient care and clinical value, and increasingly move away from explicit curation to implicit curation by NNs. Ship important features that will directly increase delta lives saved in your first 2 weeks. Join customer calls to develop a deep understanding of their fundamental motivations and needs/pain points. Next 6 months - some examples of what to expect: Help architect and deploy a scalable & cost effective ETL data pipeline with version control, outputting clean data ready for tokenisation. Help deploy our active deep learning training & validation architecture to prod, so that we can correctly eat up our '1.0' systems at the right time Build cutting edge products like global context aware chat with semantic search, care orchestration and LLM-enabled cloud telephony e2e Hire/scale the team, while implementing the right processes at the right times to maximize discounted team productivity and minimize discounted dev time cost for shipping. 6+ months - some examples of what to expect: Potential to transition to a more managerial/executive role. Lead an autonomous lance of elite engineers to fix healthcare and save lives. Work with the Client/data team to creatively ideate and ship features to improve ETL pipeline throughput and quality through a data-driven approach powered by analytics.

        "description": "Title: Web Developer Department: Creative and Marketing This role reports: Director of Creative and Marketing Location: Remote, but preference will be given to candidates based in Los Angeles, CA. Candidates must be based in a state where The Bail Project currently operates which includes the following: AZ, CA, CO, FL, GA, IN, IL, KY, MD, MO, MT, NY, NC, OH, OK, TX, PA, SC, WA About The Bail Project The Problem There is no place in the criminal justice system where money more clearly buys justice than bail. People who can‚Äôt afford bail remain in jail before trial, while those with money buy their liberty. Tying freedom to financial ability upends the presumption of innocence, tears lives apart, and perpetuates racial and economic disparities. It is also a key driver of mass incarceration. Each year, an estimated 2.5 million people sit in jail cells across America because they cannot afford bail. The Response The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to thousands of low-income people every year. We are on a mission to combat mass incarceration and demonstrate that a more humane, equitable, and effective pretrial system is possible. The Model The Bail Project uses a national revolving bail fund to pay bail for individuals who are legally presumed innocent, and whom a judge has deemed eligible for release. We then provide court reminders, transportation, and work with local partner organizations to connect our clients with voluntary social services and community-based programs. We call this model Community Release with Support, and it has proven highly effective in helping people make their court dates. As our clients‚Äô cases close, bail comes back into the fund where it is recycled to help additional people. The goal of The Bail Project is to work ourselves out of a job by gathering human stories and data from our ground work to advance legislative and policy change to end cash bail and invest in Community Release with Support (aftercashbail.org). The Team We are a community of advocates committed to ending mass incarceration and advancing racial and economic justice. Our organization consists of a central support hub and a growing network of client advocates or ‚ÄúBail Disruptors‚Äù who work in their local communities to provide bail assistance and help advance advocacy efforts on the ground.

Our APIs allow B2B companies to access the information, insights, and documentation they need to onboard and transact with their customers. Our products help product, risk, and finance teams make informed regulatory compliance and commercial credit decisions, confirm that suppliers meet federal and state licensing requirements, and register their customers with the necessary government agencies. Our verification product allows platforms like Shopify, Affirm, and Wells Fargo to determine the legitimacy of any business in the United States and automate Know Your Business (KYB) requirements. In addition, our products can be used to identify a business's industry, sanctions risks, bankruptcies, financing liens, and active or pending litigations. Enterprises such as ServiceChannel and Tesla use our products to ensure that all of their suppliers are legitimate businesses registered with the necessary government agencies. Based in San Francisco and NYC, Middesk is backed by Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners, and Y Combinator. About Middesk Engineering We believe \"velocity\" is the rate at which we effect realized value for our customers, not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; how will this change I'm about to make help our customers get jobs done? When we‚Äôre coding, we're making hundreds of micro-decisions about user experience that add up. How can I communicate this exception to our customers in a manner that helps them understand what's happened and unblock themselves? Middesk Engineering is customer-first engineering. (check out our blog post on the topic). The role Engineers have the freedom to create a lot of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems. What You'll Do Work in React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and potentially Scala, Python, and Go to solve problems for our customers. Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend, backend, API, data processors, etc. Jam with Product Managers, Designers, Ops, and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products. Share your knowledge with others in Engineering; people should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you‚Äôre early in your career, you have something to teach. Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people, and good relationships matter. Help us interview and hire other Engineers. What You‚Äôve Accomplished While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic, we‚Äôd love it if you had experience with a couple of the languages in our stack (see the first point above). We‚Äôve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster. You‚Äôve worked for a high-growth, venture-backed startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or, you've founded a company and are looking to get back into it. You‚Äôve been working as a professional Software Engineer for at least three or more years. You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value, customer acquisition cost, and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you‚Äôve done influences these metrics. Why you'll love it here Customer First: We stay energized by solving real customer problems and make each interaction meaningful and embrace the challenging path to help our customers succeed. Be an owner: We identify and tackle problems, take pride in our work, and measure impact. When we find an opportunity to improve the status quo, take it on! Act with urgency and purpose: We move quickly and simplify things as we go. We solve the problems that we have today in ways that allow us to move even faster in the future. Drive results together: We choose teamwork. We share our opinions, ask questions, understand where others are coming from, and move forward as a unified front.

Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide. Exceptional products are exceptional in all dimensions that matter. Take the Dyson vacuum cleaner. Not only is it a good at vacuuming, it‚Äôs beautiful, feels good in the hand, is portable, and is easy to use. We are looking for Fullstack Engineers to build exceptional software products for a billion people. Responsibilities Owning and implementing new features that touch multiple layers of the tech stack. E.g. creating a beautiful search experience. Creating delight. E.g. through animations and micro UI. Making the web apps faster and more reliable. E.g. reducing javascript payload or making network requests more resilient. Improving how we work. E.g. improving our component library or tools we use to translate the web app into 40+ languages. Qualifications At some point in your life, someone has told you: ‚Äúyou write good code.‚Äù You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow. Bonus: you have a good sense of humor. About Padlet Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.

Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake. Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.) Joys of engineering at Padlet We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow. A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting scale and concurrency problems. Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems. We like to craft delightful user experiences. They‚Äôre satisfying to build. We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them. We ship often. We value beautiful code. Sorrows of engineering at Padlet We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We‚Äôre working on it! Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We‚Äôre working on it!

The inefficiency of this process can delay‚Äîand in some cases block‚Äîaccess to capital when it's needed most. It‚Äôs time for the next generation of financial infrastructure builders to rise to the challenge. Finley‚Äôs software helps startups streamline the debt capital raise and management process. That way, they can spend more time focusing on their customers and less time worrying about fundraising. The Role We‚Äôre looking for Software Engineers to join our Engineering team. As an early employee, you‚Äôll be responsible for designing, building, and testing an entirely new category of capital markets software from the ground up. You‚Äôll architect and build the infrastructure that helps fintechs around the world collectively manage billions of dollars. Just as importantly, you‚Äôll help shape the engineering culture and trajectory of a seed-stage startup. We‚Äôre looking for 0 ‚Üí 1 individuals who are comfortable with autonomy early on and also excited to help build structures that will scale their own impact over time. In other words, we‚Äôre looking for candidates who want to build a lasting company just as much as they want to build industry-changing software. We believe in finding the best technology for the job, and being disciplined with only adopting the tools that actually let us move faster, build more securely, and enable a higher quality of life. We hate inefficiency and embrace debate to constantly find ways to make our lives easier and products better. Our tech stack (see below) reflects that philosophy. Your Responsibilities You will be responsible for helping architect, build, and scale the first lender-borrower relationship platform for the debt capital markets. - You will work with the team to design, product manage, and test early features for the Finley system. - You will become an expert in information security, data engineering and API design in a heavily regulated space. - You will become an expert on structured finance (no worries, we‚Äôll fill you in!) and the ways in which technology can bring standardization to a field accustomed to legacy solutions. - You will help grow the Finley team by helping interview job candidates, mentor new engineers, and document standard operating procedures. Our tech stack Backend : NodeJS + Express, Apollo Server, Typescript - Frontend : React + Hooks, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Client - Database : Postgres + Knex - Infrastructure and deploys : AWS, Docker, ECS, CDK, CodePipeline - Collaboration : Github, Papertrail, and Trello We're looking for Builders. You have experience building web applications for 3+ years and can scope and ship products independently. - Problem-solvers. You focus on delivering outcomes and prefer to use the right tool for the job, rather than building for building‚Äôs sake. (That said, getting excited about a modern tech stack built on Node.js, React, and AWS wouldn‚Äôt hurt. See above.) - Collaborators. You like collaborating with Business, Design, and Product functions in addition to other engineers, and you believe that the best solutions can only emerge when everyone has a seat at the table. - Systems thinkers. You enjoy the complexity of designing for a range of stakeholders (think borrowers, lenders, and banks) and source systems. You get excited about designing for the long-term. - Team-builders. You look forward to helping recruit, train, and mentor a team of engineers at Finley.",
