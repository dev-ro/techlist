        "description": "A little about us: The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed. Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you. A day in the life: You’ll likely start your day at a customer location near our Red Alpha offices, checking to see if there are any important items that have just come up. If not, you’ll move on to improving a dashboard or other data product that you’re responsible for, or perhaps produce a weekly output the customer is expecting. You’ll be using R or Python a lot, but also Git, Mongo, some commercial software and several other usual suspects. Once a week you’ll attend a team meeting (with 4 others) to prioritize things, and you’ll have a lot of interaction with the team otherwise, typically several times per day. You’ll need your sense of humor and need to be willing to leave your ego at the door. What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. All of our data scientists need the following skills: Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list. A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects. For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects. For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory: Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding) Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React Why Red Alpha? Every day, our elite customers are pushing through \"the grind\" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we bring digital transformation to the fight. Some of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned: Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life: Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid holidays (all of which we treat as floaters). You can stay at your best: As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.

        "created_on": 1720586719.693827,
        "description": "A little about us: The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed. Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you. A day in the life: This role is hands-on across all areas as a data scientist; from understanding customer requirements and collecting data, to developing visualizations and advanced analytics to make data-driven recommendations and decisions. You will work directly with intel analysts to develop prototypes and novel solutions that satisfy complex operational needs. What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. All of our data scientists need the following skills: Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list. A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects. For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects. For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. For this particular role, you will also need: Large dataset experience Strong familiarity with data science applications such as association analysis, graph/network analytics, clustering, text analytics, classification and regression (multivariate and logistic). Training in the design and implementation of static and dynamic visualizations in R, Python, Tableau, or similar visualization software. These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory: Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Experience or exposure to Natural Language Processing (NLP). Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding) Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React Why Red Alpha? Every day, our elite customers are pushing through \"the grind\" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom.

If you just \"apply click\" without answering the questions on our website, we cannot consider your application.*** This role is open to U.S. citizens only. _______________________________________________________________________ For this role (multiple vacancies): We are seeking a lead AI/ML engineer (possibly multiple senior engineering positions) who is not afraid to tackle \"impossible\" computer science problems at scale. The goal of this position is to use AI/ML to cut down the theoretical search space in a specific class of computer science challenges. This is really cool, difficult work with impact -- definitely NOT using AI to generate pictures of six-fingered people or create text passages to help children cheat on their essay assignments. Our client is a small, growing company whose founders have successfully built and sold two prior firms, most recently to one of Wall Street's \"Magnificent Seven.\" The founders self-funded the new firm along with select angel money and only recently took a large venture round so they could scale their product. Suffice to say, they are extremely well funded with plenty of runway! Morale is also so high that no one has left the company voluntarily. This position is full time, in office, near Vienna, VA. Salary range is $180,000 to $250,000+, depending on experience and equity mix. (Many of the employees are already millionaires with the equity.) With rare exceptions, we are only considering candidates with a computer science degrees because, in our experience, this background is needed to pass the technical interviews. Physicists, mathematicians, and other pure science degrees have typically not done well. This position is right for you if: -- You have built real AI/ML systems and ideally delivered them to production. -- You are a top 1% software engineer who is seeking to solve tough problems with a top notch team. -- You could easily get a job at a FAANG (or have worked there in the past) but that type of bureaucracy now sounds miserable. -- You think medium to hard leetcode type problems are easy and fun. -- You know several computer languages and can pick up whatever you need. (C++ and Nix a plus if you really insist but that's not critical.) -- You are comfortable nerding out and giving a technical presentation about something cool you have done. If you apply but this company is not a fit, we will consider you for other available positions as well! _______________________________________________________________________ About us: Task Force Talent is a specialized recruiting firm for science, engineering, and security careers. Our clients include seed to Series C startups working on AI, cybersecurity, and various novel software and hardware technologies. We also work with small to medium size government contractors, and we help leading venture capital firms find talent for their portfolio companies. Most of our jobs are in VA, DC, and MD; however we also have some positions in Salt Lake City, UT. We should be adding positions in New York, Boston, and the Pacific Northwest in the near future. All of our positions are highly competitive -- our clients are generally looking for the top 5% of technical candidates.
