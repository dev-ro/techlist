You will be responsible for core product contributions, rapid-prototyping, and production-level concerns including infrastructure and security. As a backend engineer of a fast-growing fintech startup you are going to move the needle, but it will require a split personality: Your Dr. Jekyll leans towards correctness, tight testing, and advancing the mental constructs of the organization with a series of logical hypotheses and tests; your Hyde-side is one that focuses on brutal prioritization in a sea of possibilities, good-enough testing for a code base that must be deliberately but also organically grown, and the understanding that systems must serve people, not the other way around. Our mission is to create fair, effective, and simple financial pathways to help 100M Americans reach their financial goals. Investors include Lightspeed, Coatue and GGV. Founders are serial entrepreneurs who co-founded and served as C-suite executives at 3 FinTech unicorns.

We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more. Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world. Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems. Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it.

        "description": "About Numeric Numeric is building the modern accounting & finance platform. Companies today depend on Numeric's workflow and data platform to collaborate, monitor and analyze data, and share insights about their financials. We believe an organization with up-to-date, accurate, rich financial data is empowered to move faster and smarter. Unfortunately, the tools and systems have not been keeping up. The complexity of work and granularity of data has ballooned, and old, slow software and simplistic tools only facilitate the manual work; they do little to solve the fundamental challenges of accounting and finance. As a product-focused company, we know that a great product and engineering team can build the tools to give our users superpowers. We work to free people from the manual and the tedious, and to bring delight to their work. Numeric is backed by Founders Fund, Long Journey Ventures, and others as well as founders from Ramp, Segment, and more. About The Role Every engineer at Numeric is a product engineer. We believe the quality of a company's product is a direct reflection of its inclusion (or not) of engineers in every step of the product process. Ownership here means not only building, testing, and shipping your work, but also contributing to planning, scoping, and discovery. The role encompasses the entire loop of product iteration–observing and learning from users, designing solutions, building, and repeating until we've exceeded users' expectations. Passionate builders improve through iteration, and learn by making mistakes. Our ideal candidate takes great pride in building and is excited by the ability to move fast. We place a great deal of emphasis on speed and ownership, and don't let anything get in your way. Projects we're working on Here are a few projects you could get started with: Building the transaction monitoring engine to spot anomalies and help our users pre-empt costly errors Designing scheduling and automation of revenue and expenses Improving our one-of-a-kind flexible search & reporting platform for financial data Extending our real-time syncing integrations Launching new workflow automations on our generalized task system How we work The engineering team here is a high-ownership, fast-paced, customer-focused group. We ship early & often. Deploys go out every day, and engineers ship & verify their own work. We keep things simple and do not incur operational cost or complexity until it's necessary. We stay grounded in our users and humble about what we don't know. We know that discovering the best solution is the result of an iterative, user-centric process. Finally, we move fast. With less than 2 years' time we're competing with existing players that have all been around for 10+ years. About You You thrive in a fast-paced and iterative environment. You are driven more by customer impact than technology. When building software, you can find the 80/20 solution to a problem. You're excited to build a new company, and to collaborate across all functions of the organization. You're allergic to premature optimization in all its forms; you focus on the larger goals at hand. The prospect of taking on incumbents as a small, high-performing team is an exciting challenge to you. You thrive when given more ownership and responsibility.

        "description": "✍🏻 About daydream daydream is a platform that automates programmatic SEO, end-to-end. The platform helps businesses identify search patterns, creates content at scale, and automatically improves that content. We've raised >$2M from leading investors like Basis Set Ventures, WndrCo, SOMA Capital and current and former Heads of Growth/Product Growth at companies like Notion, Airtable, Webflow and Dropbox. We're on a high-growth trajectory and we're looking for people who want to join us on the journey to building a billion-dollar company. Our team previously worked together at Flixed, a startup we bootstrapped to $2M+ in revenue almost purely on the back of programmatic SEO. 🔧 The problem we're trying to solve Heads of Growth love programmatic SEO. It’s the secret growth playbook used by companies like Zapier, Canva, to acquire millions of visitors. The problem is, building a pSEO engine currently requires work from SEO analysts, content marketers, software engineers, data scientists and others. As a result, it’s logistically complicated and expensive. You can hire specialized agencies, but they cost $50K+ per month. 🧑‍💻 How we're solving this problem daydream is building a SaaS platform that automates every piece of building a programmatic SEO engine. Everything from identifying search queries, to producing 90th percentile quality content at scale, all the way to automatically updating that content. 🪴 Why we're hiring Demand for daydream is growing fast as our ARR has already doubled since the inception of our company, all before launching a generally available product. This is exciting, but it also means we need to hire to build product faster and meet the demand. We’re looking for senior engineers that are excited to work with LLMs to serve one of the biggest markets in the world. 👋🏻 The people and environment Here are three key elements of our culture: Push the pace No sandbagging allowed! Everyone at daydream is expected to proactively identify when a particular goal can be met faster, and to push for acceleration. A real example of how this value has been applied — we initially thought we would hit a certain revenue milestone within 1 year. We realized we can do it in half the time, so we shortened our timeline to hit that goal to 5 months instead. Build something you’re proud of Speed of execution is important, but only if it’s in service of delivering a delightful experience to the customer. We want you to look back at what you’ve built at daydream and feel a deep sense of satisfaction. A real example of how this value has been applied — In the past, we’ve prioritized “wowing” the customer at each release of daydream, even at the earliest phases. Speed is no excuse for delivering a poor experience. Five star customer service only The bar for customer service at daydream is always exceeding the customer’s expectations. It is not “meeting” the customer’s expectations. A real example of how this value has been applied — We’ve had situations where the customer is unintentionally moving slower than is possible with their SEO strategy. In these situations, we’ve proactively encouraged the customer to move faster. 🤝 The people you’ll be working with Thenuka (CEO): Thenuka was previously the founder at CEO at Flixed, which he bootstrapped to $2M+ in revenue almost exclusively using programmatic SEO. Prior to that he was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Hustle Fund and Chief of Staff to the COO at Pango, a cybersecurity company with $100M+ in annual revenue. Shravan (CTO): Shravan was previously an Engineering Lead at Flixed. Before that, Shravan worked as a Software Engineer at Facebook for three years, where he worked on mass-scale web scraping for Facebooks’ Jobs product, and Meta Reality Labs. Wesley (Chief of Staff): Wesley previously spearheaded growth initiatives at Hustle Fund’s Angel Squad, and before that, worked at Montage Partners. Additionally, he ran his own consulting business focusing on audience growth. 🥞 Our stack C# (.NET 7/8) TypeScript (T3 based) Next.JS Postgres LLMs (GPT) 👷🏻‍♀️ What You’ll Be Doing Here Ownership areas: Building the daydream web app: As our engineering team is only a few people, we'll look to you to architect the daydream app frontend and backend, taking into account considerations like performance, maintainability, security, scalability. App Quality and UX: You'll be responsible for maintaining a high quality bar for the app. Work closely with our designer throughout the engineering cycle to ensure the app is intuitive for users to work with. We want to move fast, but not at the cost of quality. Working with customers: An important part of this role is to engage with customers, gather feedback and understand their specific needs. You'll need to translate this feedback into actionable technical requirements and improvements, ensuring that the app continually evolves in alignment with user needs. 1 month: Build context: You'll get to know Shravan, Thenuka, Wesley, and the rest of the team as you work on the daydream app. The frontend uses a T3 inspired React stack and is written in TypeScript. You'll gain and understanding of our app structure and roadmap. Learn the product: We believe that it's important for everyone on the team to understand our product well. So, soon after you join, you'll work with Thenuka to create and deliver content to a real customer. This will help you understand the technology we have and share your ideas!

Within 1 month you'll have committed your first few features and bug fixes. 3 months: Research exploratory ideas: As you learnt the ropes, you've implemented features that have been scoped out by our team. With the context you've gained on the product, help research our more exploratory ideas. Data can help guide decisions, but instinct is important too.

        "created_on": 1720650081.9405186,
        "description": "ABOUT RETOOL: Nearly every company in the world runs on custom business software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal usage. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, moderating content, managing marketplaces, rolling out new features, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, providing customer support…the list is nearly endless. For most companies, building and maintaining all of these tools demands a lot of engineering time—scarce, expensive resources better put to use on customer-facing products. At Retool, we’re designing a new type of development environment that makes it dramatically faster and easier to build all of this software. Retool unifies the ease of visual programming with the power of code, while abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks of development. We believe that the future of software development lies in being a force multiplier for developers and technical builders, helping them move considerably faster and build a lot more software. It’s akin to a new version of Visual Basic, HyperCard, or Flash—with a bit of Figma and some future-of-programming vibes thrown on top. Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools, to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU: Retool started as a way to address obstacles with internal tools and has grown into a company that solves internal tooling for thousands of companies (big and small). We’ve done a lot with a little–we have a growing engineering team and a laundry list of features and foundational improvements we want to tackle. To continue our fast-paced growth, we need to build a world-class engineering team. You’ll help us get there by owning end-to-end projects, talking with customers, and ultimately supporting the growth of Retool the product and the business. WHAT YOU'LL DO: You’ll own projects from start to finish working with internal and external stakeholders. As examples, you may improve our user onboarding experience, work with customers to identify and build new features, or strengthen the foundation of our operations. Because we often make product decisions based on customer feedback, you’ll have the opportunity to connect with customers and build something that solves their problems. You’ll also weigh in on our product roadmap as the end-user yourself. Retool is built primarily in Javascript and Typescript, Node on the backend, and React on the frontend. We’ll look to you to bring your skillset and experience to build within this environment and impact our codebase. You’ll also engage in technical decision-making with the team, participate in sprint planning, and help our engineering team expand its skillset. To that end, you’ll also play a key role in helping us grow the team through interviewing potential new team members. WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH: As an engineer, you’ll work with designers, customer engineers, and support engineers, and our go-to-market teams. Engineers make a lot of product decisions, and you’ll partner with our design team as you scope and build your projects. We’re a hard-working, passionate bunch who are motivated by collaboration, strong results, and bringing the impact of Retool to our customers. When we’re in the office, we enjoy eating lunch (and occasionally dinner!) together, and we’ve been known to be a little sarcastic. But at the root of it all, we come together to show our customers and not-quite-yet customers how Retool can make them and their companies more efficient and successful. If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you! IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL: Improve the UX of the Retool core editor, which involves plenty of interesting problems, both technical (e.g. \"how do we implement our drag and drop system in a performant way?\") and otherwise (e.g. \"how do we handle the pushing of existing components when dragging new components on?\") Build entirely new product lines (e.g. an interface to share queries — both SQL, and REST + GraphQL across your company) Debug customer problems + build features for them (e.g. \"the Google Sheets integration doesn't support adding rows\", and \"what's the best way to support that? Via cell ranges, or via a lightweight, home-grown ORM?\") Write technical blog posts (e.g. \"here's how we implemented role-based access controls\") and documentation (e.g. if you build the Google Sheets integration, you will write documentation on how it's used) Help assess and recruit future engineers THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING: 5+ years experience in professional software development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups Experience owning technically challenging and demanding cross-functional projects Experience across the entire stack, from backend to frontend (and if you have a preference, we’d love to hear it!) Experience in Javascript Experience with cloud based infrastructure like Azure, AWS or GCP Ability to make technical decisions quickly, while looping in key stakeholders, too A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we’re building meets their needs Habit of introspection and understanding what’s helped you be successful in the past Bonus points if you have experience in mentoring other team members, and have previously worked closely with designers OUR U.S. BENEFITS: Generous medical, dental and vision benefits 401(K) plan enrollment and matching up to an effective rate of 4% Paid company holidays and unlimited time off; take what you need! Annual continuing education stipend Paid parental leave and family planning support Wellness benefits including mental health, meditation support, OneMedical membership Retool is currently set up to employ all roles in the US and specific roles in the UK.

The problem we’re trying to solve The internet revolutionized the way financial services are distributed, making them more accessible and convenient than ever before.

Today, teams are faced with the increasing challenge of navigating the complex landscape of compliance and onboarding. Manual due diligence processes are time-consuming and difficult to scale, hindering the ability to efficiently identify and mitigate risks. How We’re Solving This Problem This is where Greenlite comes in. Our mission is to boost the signal amidst the noise, empowering financial institutions to make informed decisions and expand access to financial services for the businesses and individuals who need it most. With the help of large language models, we're transforming the way compliance and onboarding teams operate, enabling them to work smarter, faster, and more effectively.

        "description": "Why join Pave? At Pave, our vision is simple - Make Compensation Fair. How are we going to get there? By building the most intelligent compensation platform, powered by the largest real-time compensation dataset on earth. We partner with our customers to help them build and retain world-class teams through planning, communicating and benchmarking their team’s compensation in real time. And you don’t have to just hear it from us — you can hear it from our customers: Hover, Plaid, Fanduel and more! We’re growing fast, building an incredible team and product, and having plenty of fun as we do it in our San Francisco and New York City offices. If operating with intellectual honesty, playing to win, and focusing on upholding a platinum standard sounds exciting - we highly encourage you to reach out. We’d love to partner on our journey to change the world of compensation! Product Engineering @ Pave At the heart of every company’s compensation strategy are the following pillars: compensation bands , compensation planning , and total rewards communication . Creating and maintaining compensation bands in an ever-changing labor market is equal parts art and science. These bands are then utilized in various compensation planning strategies to reward high performers and retain top talent. Finally, the output of compensation planning is visualized for employees in their Total Rewards portals where they can continue to simulate how their wealth can grow through refresh programs, promotions, and company growth. Our Market Pricing and Plan & Execute teams build the products that enable our customers do so in a frictionless and transparent way. Over the next year, we have an ambitious roadmap that encompass the entire compensation strategy lifecycle: how customers define their compensation philosophies, model their jobs in Pave, understand trends in market data, translate trends into their compensation bands, apply band adjustments into merit cycle planning, communicate compensation adjustments to eligible employees, and help employees understand the value of their compensation over time. Within our agile teams, we value strong ownership and collaboration. Team members move between ideation, scoping, and execution in a matter of days while closely iterating with cross functional partners on requirements. We expect you to be comfortable and excited about navigating ambiguity. We’re looking for product-centric engineers to help us embark on this journey together — we’re only scratching the surface! What we're looking for 3+ years of fullstack engineering experience using modern web technologies (TypeScript, React, Node/Express, MySQL), preferably at technology companies Strong product sense: You leverage your customer understanding and empathy to make the right tradeoffs for what should be MVP, and what should come next Ability to adjust approach: You have a good sense for when you should cut corners to ship a new piece of functionality, and when you should take the time to invest in a sound architecture for the long-haul Comfortable with ambiguity: You should be comfortable “filling in the gaps” in product / design specs. The prospect of being able to prototype to test ideas out before committing to building is exciting to you. Nice to have: experience working at B2B SaaS tech companies, especially during hypergrowth This role is eligible for sponsorship. Compensation, It's What We Do. This salary range may include multiple levels. Your level is based on our assessment of your interview performance and experience, which you can always ask the hiring manager about to understand in more detail. Salary is just one component of Pave's total compensation package for employees. Your total rewards package at Pave will include equity, top-notch medical, dental and vision coverage, commuter benefits, catered lunch, an unlimited PTO policy, and many other region-specific benefits. Pave's salary range for this position $166,600—$264,500 USD Our Compensation Philosophy Pave’s compensation philosophy is to target the 75th percentile of the market for both cash and equity at your job level. This means that the “mid point” of every band at Pave is the 75th percentile of the broader market. Pave also has a merit-based philosophy when it comes to compensation increases. We run a performance cycle twice per year to evaluate employees’ performance. Higher than average performance ratings result in compensation increases to the upper end of the individual’s compensation range for their role. The result is that high performers at Pave are paid above the 75th percentile of the market at large. Pave is committed to pay equity. If you get an offer from Pave, it will be based on your level as determined by your interview performance. And nothing else. We explicitly do not negotiate salary and equity to ensure that we aren’t introducing bias that could lead to pay inequities within the team between candidates who have different negotiation tactics.

How We Work We like to do work with purpose; a lot of our clients are higher ed, non-profit and charities, and government contracts with state/city departments. Last Call Media has a nontraditional company structure; we have no \"people managers\" and the individuals that do really well here are self-starters who can work independently, but know when to ask for help. We're a highly collaborative environment. From the projects we work on to the way our company is run, we believe that the more perspectives we're able to take into account, the better things will be. We like to maintain alignment by checking in early and often and communicating frequently. We like to avoid people completing large deliverables in a vacuum, where misalignments can grow large. Because of our nontraditional company structure, our highly collaborative environment, and our frequent check-ins, we approach accountability a little differently than many other organizations by having a high level of trust with everyone. Our work is the product of our collaboration--if improvements need to be made, we approach them as a team as opposed to placing blame on individuals. Last Call encourages people to maintain a good work/life balance. People do not work on weekends, and we do not interrogate people who want to take time off. We do ask that all employees schedule their work days to have at least a five hour overlap with 9:00 am - 5:00 pm eastern time (EDT/EST), but how that ends up working out is different for everyone. What matters most is that your team can count on you to attend meetings and meet project deadlines. We heavily utilize Slack and Jira for frequent daily communication. Other tools in our belt include Google Apps (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.), Confluence, Harvest, and more that are specific to specialized teams. Teams at LCM are based around a specific project, and will have their own meeting cadences (daily standup, retros, etc.) as well. Almost everyone at Last Call is a member of one or more teams, and we come together as a company (virtually) regularly. All of us at LCM pride ourselves on being: Able to empathize, which helps us understand the needs of the client, the customer, the product, and the team at LCM Highly communicative Able to work independently Comfortable asking for help Experienced with communicating with clients directly Eager and motivated to learn new concepts Team players in a collaborative environment Fast learners Compensation & How To Apply: This position is compensated at a salary commensurate with skill and experience, with an anticipated range of $115,000-140,000 USD annually.

Like any source of raw power, it must be harnessed and refined for use. Vitalik and the Ethereum team laid out a plan for this refining process back in 2020. Rollups make the Ethereum blockchain more accessible in theory, but in practice building and operating your own chain is exceedingly complicated. To open up development in crypto and the next generation of applications, accessing onchain compute needs to be as easy and reliable as accessing compute in the cloud. We’re making that possible at Conduit. Conduit is the center for onchain compute. We deploy and operate modular rollups for apps and ecosystems of every size so they can access all the blockspace and throughput they need. With Conduit Deploy, teams can launch their own chain in a few clicks and trust it’s operated, maintained, and updated 24/7, 365 by Conduit’s RollOps team. Then we journey alongside our customers as they and crypto technology grow, establishing new standards together. We get that building onchain can still feel daunting. So we put experienced Web 2 infrastructure engineers alongside some of the earliest crypto contributors to bring cloud stability to crypto possibility. That’s how we can offer 99.999% uptime as well as day-one compatibility with the latest upgrades like Dencun. As projects scale, our RollOps team ensures their chains scale with them – all the while powered by optimal stack configurations customized to their needs. But all this reliability means nothing if people can’t access it. That’s why we brought product design and automation to crypto infrastructure. Conduit Deploy allows anyone from hackathon projects and startups to enterprise companies to start building on their own dedicated chain with no rollup expertise or code required. Here they can access Conduit-vetted frameworks, integrations, and scaling solutions all in one place. Even industry-leading teams with highly capable engineers like Zora, Aevo, and Mode entrust us to operate their rollups so that they can avoid spending time and money on undifferentiated development and instead focus on inventing new onchain applications. History has shown that most advanced tech pulls back and allows people’s experiences to take the lead. It’s time for crypto to advance. For infrastructure to release its grip on applications and for onchain compute to be immediately accessible on-demand. There’s been so much talk about what crypto will do for society. With Conduit, now the tech can finally step aside so app builders can build. About The Role In this role you'll be working closely with the CEO to develop, maintain, and improve the node and supporting infrastructure we run at Conduit -- including exploring Reth and it's potential for implementation. We value people who can quickly obtain a deep technical understanding of new domains and enjoy being self-directed and identifying the most important problems to solve. As a Node EVM Engineer, you should: Have a deep understanding of the EVM and how external tooling integrates with it Have experience hacking on the EVM itself or auxiliary tooling like debuggers, block explorers, or tracers. Have strong opinions on what the best tooling looks like for developers on EVM chains We think you’ll find this work really exciting if you: Love the EVM for what it is, and are excited about building best in class tooling and infrastructure for it and around it. Have experience designing, implementing, and running production services Can debug problems across the stack, such as networking issues, performance problems, or memory leaks Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done Our tech stack Our infrastructure is built on Kubernetes, Postgres, and Cloud Tasks on GCP. While we value experience with these technologies, we are primarily looking for engineers with strong technical skills and the ability to quickly pick up new tools and frameworks.

Hard problems are often solved by people who didn't know it was impossible. We're also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too.

Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide. For a majority of the world, the mobile device is their first computer. For many it’s their only computer. We are looking for Mobile Engineers to improve our mobile apps so we can improve the lives of a billion people. Responsibilities Building new features for our iOS and/or Android apps. E.g. a voice recorder with audio effects. Making apps faster and more reliable. E.g. making network calls more resistant to spotty internet connections. Improving how we work. E.g. improving our internationalization pipelines we use to translate our app into 40+ languages. Qualifications At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you write good code.” You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow. Bonus: you have a good sense of humor. About Padlet Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet. Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years. Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here. Tech stack Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.) Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python. Web: VueJS, Tailwind. Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake. Joys of engineering at Padlet We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow. A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting real-time collaboration problems. Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems. We like to craft delightful user experiences. They’re satisfying to build. We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them. We ship often. We value beautiful code. Sorrows of engineering at Padlet We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it! Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it! Some people you‘d be working with Josh Hewitt: insists that wallabies and kangaroos are different animals, artificially inflating the biodiversity of his homeland. Is excellent at surgically improving an existing, complicated system. Colin Teahan: lives for one-liners. E.g: Colleague: “Wouldn’t it be funny if Iron Man were anemic?” Teahan: “It would be IRONIC.” Single-handedly wrote early versions of our iOS and Android apps. The office Our office is in the middle of Presidio, a beautiful national park. We’re 5 minutes from the beach, a walk we take often. The WiFi works outdoors. You can work sitting in a lawn overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. The office itself is designed to be a space for all your interests and hobbies. We have a meditation room, game room, library, podcasting studio, art studio, kids room, and full makerspace with 3d printers, presses, laser cutters, sewing machines, and more. Benefits Top tier medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family. One Medical and Cue memberships for you and your family. 401(k) with matching. Commuter benefits. FSA. Good stock options. Catered lunches and dinners. 20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens. All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year. Special time to join Because we're small, there's a lot of energy. And because we have tremendous traction, your first commit touches millions. This combination is rare and quite satisfying.",

Students can post questions, memes, polls, and chat with other verified students while maintaining control over their identity and privacy. Fizz communities prioritize safety, authenticity, and inclusion through community-based moderation.

What we’ve done We first launched Fizz at Stanford in July 2021 and have since seen >95% of undergraduates join the app, half of which use Fizz every day. Since then, we have raised over $41 million from NEA, Owl Ventures, and Lightspeed, built a rock-solid engineering team with decades of experience at top tech companies, and expanded Fizz to be the dominant community platform at 200+ colleges. Where we’re going We are currently in the process of rapidly expanding to all US universities, with the goal of getting there by the end of the 2023-2024 academic school year.

Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback. Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn't know it was impossible. We're also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues.

        "description": "About Mixpanel Mixpanel is an event analytics platform for builders who need answers from their data at their fingertips—no SQL required. When everyone in the organization can see and learn from the impact of their work on product, marketing, and company revenue metrics, they are poised to make better decisions. Over 9,000 paid customers, including companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Sweetgreen, Samsara, and Uber, use Mixpanel to understand their customers and measure progress. Our commitment is to provide the most comprehensive and reliable analytics platform accessible and trusted by all. We are actively recruiting for multiple Software Engineers across different levels for our org! About The Role Mixpanel is powered by a custom distributed database. This system ingests more than 1 Trillion user-generated events every month while ensuring end-to-end latencies of under a minute and queries typically scan more than 1 Quadrillion events over the span of a month. Over the last year, our inbound traffic has doubled. As our existing customers grow in volume and we add new ones, we expect this growth in traffic to continue. The Distributed Systems engineering teams are responsible for adding new capabilities and ensuring the smooth operation of the underlying systems. Responsibilities Mixpanel's infrastructure runs on Google Cloud Platform. We rely on Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services. We primarily use Golang for writing services and all internal communication happens via GRPC. We use a combination of C and C++ wherever Golang doesn't meet our performance goals. As an engineer on the Distributed Systems teams, you'll be responsible for: Working with other engineers to build distributed systems that can handle data at scale Debugging production issues across multiple services and all levels of our infrastructure stack Ensuring reliability and uptime of the services you're responsible for Keeping an eye on how much your service costs every month and removing inefficiencies wherever possible Improving engineering standards and holding a high bar for code quality and simplicity Pushing the boundaries on how our customers analyze their product data A typical project requires a thorough understanding of how not just your service works but also how it interacts with other components. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect. Most of the systems in our stack provide at least once semantics. As a result, we risk duplicating events that flow through them. To overcome this limitation, we added support for event deduplication that can work at our scale. Typical approaches for deduplication don't perform well on large amounts of data, so we had to do something highly custom for our stack. We wrote about this on our engineering blog here. Back in 2019, we migrated our ingestion API service from Python to Golang for better performance and type safety. We had to do this while ensuring that both systems handle data the same way. Because we had to compare, both, HTTP responses and transformed payloads, nothing out of the box worked for us. This blog post talks about how we did the actual migration without any customer visible downtime. In 2021, as our traffic grew almost 100%, the cost of storing data became untenable. Our engineers worked on an incremental way to eventually realize almost $30000 in savings per month. If projects like the ones listed above excite you, the Distributed Systems engineering team will be a great fit. We're Looking For Someone Who Has We have openings across multiple Distributed Systems teams. We're looking for engineers who have: A strong grasp of computer science fundamentals when it comes to dealing with distributed systems and networks. You'll routinely run into issues where \"one in a million\" chances actually happen in production A knack for problem-solving and thinking from first principles.

        "description": "The Role We're looking for an experienced frontend engineer. We want someone with programming (and ideally also design) chops who can own the frontend and take our product to the next level as we scale. We're building a PaaS that runs in a user's own cloud (basically Heroku on k8s) and we've converted some of Heroku's largest enterprise users as well as a large base of high-growth startups despite starting just a little over a year ago. Now that we're hitting our stride, we're focused on capturing as much mindshare as possible, so we need someone who can take the polish and devX of our PaaS to the next level. This role would involve maximum ownership. Our entire engineering team is currently full-stack (leaning backend) or on infra side. I (Justin) do most of the day-to-day FE/UX work as a founder, so we want someone with more experience who can do it worlds better. You Will Obsess over delivering the best possible user flow for teams on Porter Elevate the design language of our platform Incrementally refactor the frontend without hampering the team's velocity Raise the standard for code quality and our engineering culture Some Of The Technical Challenges We Face Rock solid UI/UX for onboarding - our platform automatically provisions resources to the user's cloud account and needs to robustly handle a variety of permissions and infra-related errors. Abstracting CI and Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles. Auto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial. Tech Stack Web: React (styled-components), TypeScript Backend: Go, Kubernetes + Helm APIs, Postgres, Redis Infrastructure: AWS, GCP Porter is open source.

        "description": "View the Porter GitHub repo The Role We're looking for a full stack engineer who is fluent in React/Typescript but comfortable working across the entire stack. This includes building on top of our Go backend as well as working directly with the Kubernetes and Helm APIs. Since Porter is a PaaS that abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes, deeply considered design/architectural decisions are the lifeblood of our platform. The best implementation is not always the most obvious one, so an appetite for rigorously evaluating the tradeoffs of different options is essential. You will be expected to push critical code on a daily basis while also working on larger features that constantly expand the capabilities of the platform. You Will Build and maintain new features on the Porter dashboard Develop our Go API to accommodate additional k8s/Helm behaviors Create applets and add-ons for popular technologies like MySQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc. Improve the UI and organization of the dashboard (strong UI/UX background is a nice to have) Raise the standard for code quality and our engineering culture Who We're Looking For We value rate of learning above all else. Full stack experience and fluency with React/TypeScript is expected, but less familiarity with Go/Kubernetes is fine if you're a voracious and self-directed learner. Infrastructure management isn't rocket science, but it does involve thinking and working across multiple levels of abstraction at once. If the idea of wrangling that complexity is exciting and not daunting to you, we'd love to talk. As is the case with most early-stage startups, you should be comfortable with regularly shifting priorities and iterating at a very high (daily) velocity. Some Of The Technical Challenges We Face Abstracting Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles. Auto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial. Cloud Agnosticism - one of Porter's main benefits is that you get the same interface for managing services regardless of where you host. Our job is to reduce multi-cloud infrastructure complexity to a unified interface. Many Integrations - our philosophy is to never reinvent the wheel, so we leverage tools like GitHub Actions, existing container registries, and the APIs of various cloud providers. An issue with any one of these integrations interrupts functionality, so properly handling interactions with numerous services is crucial. Sample Projects You Might Work On Build a dashboard that gives an infra-level overview of machines being managed by Porter and their current resource utilization Implement live email/Slack alerts for successful or failed deployments Develop a deployment pipeline builder that lets users seamlessly promote services across multiple clusters and environments (ex: dev -> staging -> prod) Create one-click deployable applets for popular technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka, Cassandra, etc.) Tech Stack Web: React (styled-components), TypeScript Backend: Go, Kubernetes + Helm APIs, Postgres, Redis Infrastructure: AWS, GCP Porter is open source.

        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays). About The Role Remember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off. We're looking to bring someone on with 8+ years of experience. What You'll Do You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build a tool that allows admins to manage all their workspaces at once. You'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might optimize our block data model. You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include building dashboards and alerting to ensure that our features are reliable. What We're Looking For Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. Shipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL. Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Bonus Points You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres. You have prior experience working on Enterprise systems: SAML, SCIM, eDiscovery, Access control mechanisms like RBAC, and more. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

        "description": "WHO ARE WE? There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place. As the savings gap in the country widens, it's imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company's savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future. Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software. Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era. Vestwell's north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike. Vestwell's focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider. As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals. WHY VESTWELL? With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we've set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We're ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun. Who are we looking for? Vestwell's payroll integrations engineering team is seeking a Software Engineer with demonstrated experience creating and consuming REST APIs using Python or other object-oriented languages to enable communication between Vestwell's systems and those of our partners. The ideal candidate will be experienced working within a kanban development team, writing well-tested, maintainable and clean code and collaborating day to day with stakeholders on our product and operations teams. You're a great fit for our team if you: Can balance detail-oriented tasks with long term strategy and scale initiatives.

        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role As a Core Product engineer, you will directly contribute to the foundational pieces of Notion's building blocks. You will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that allows Notion to achieve the connected workspace vision. Your work will include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing functionality to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization, has outsize impact on how fast Notion grows, and guides the full-stack direction. Moreover, you will be presented with challenging technical problems as Notion’s product needs are complex. You’ll also play a key role in identifying and executing against technical investments that ensure the long-term quality, reliability, and performance of databases in Notion as we scale. You will help define team norms, operating principles, team culture, and much more. What You'll Achieve You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more. You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions. You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems. Skills You'll Need To Bring Proven track record of execution: You have 5+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers. Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates. Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Nice To Haves You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres. You have built or contributed to an internal platform or framework in the past. You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

        "description": "Who We Are Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too. At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 250,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more. Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond. We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors. We’re looking for strong technical generalists to contribute to our core product and help us build the foundation for our rapidly expanding company. What We're Looking For Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small. You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell. You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college. Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects. What You'll Do You'll be tasked with a wide range of projects. Each engineer has a realm they focus on, but we're still small enough that we don't have the luxury of deep specialization. We're looking for technical generalists that aren’t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase). Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects. You'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to our strategy decisions. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit. The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. We're increasingly using Docker (both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server). A lot of our code runs in the browser (including some Tensorflow JS) but we're also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages. You certainly don't need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team. We’re especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for rapidly scaling the engineering organization (for example: we currently have limited tests and are not using an opinionated front-end framework -- things that will need to change over the coming months in order to be able to seamlessly expand the team). Example Projects - Creating a filtering interface so our users can mix and match their images based on metadata like the time of day they were captured, the GPS location, or custom tags they've applied. - Expanding our annotation tool to support new functionality (like polygonal annotations image segmentation). - Integrating the core app with external APIs for things like outsourcing annotation tasks and analyzing deployed model performance. - Streamlining our onboarding flow. - Deeper integrations with our other products like Roboflow Universe and our REST API. - Next-generation model assisted labeling. - Optimizing speed and scalability. 📅 Within one month, you will… Spend the first week onboarding in person with your manager (you'll come to our NY or SF Hub!) Start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure. Ship a substantial new feature to an end user or to our team within your first week Build your first Roboflow computer vision product (if you haven't already) 📅 Within six months, you will… Attend your first all company onsite Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product. Who You'll Be Working With Our team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others. You will directly be working with our Engineering Lead and a team of Full Stack Engineers. Where You'll Work Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best! When You'll Work Roboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you’ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed. What You'll Receive To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market. 💰 The target compensation for this role is $165,000 base salary. 📈 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights: A $4000 Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work with alongside other Roboflowers. A $350 Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high - speed internet at home or a co-working space. Coverage of up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family. Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision and Roboflow.

This is a new vertical (we’ve played a substantial role in creating) that is experiencing rapid growth. I’m excited about this role as designing and building software are two passions of mine. At other organizations, engineering and design are separate entities. At Navattic, you can do both. You’ll help our team ship faster by leading technical designs across the organization and ensure the customer experience is at the forefront. Core responsibilities include development of Navattic’s component library, creation of high-fidelity engineering designs in Tailwind Playground, Stackblitz, or Figma (tool of choice) and development of new features end-to-end (full-stack).\\ For this role we are looking for an engineer with years of experience working on advanced projects in Typescript and React. We’re looking for examples of impressive projects you’ve worked on. We hope this engineer will join our team in aiming for and delivering work at an exceptional level of engineering craft. Examples Of What Engineers At Navattic Have Worked On Developed a novel process for serializing and replaying web applications (the core of interactive product demos) Built generalized support for serializing web applications across browsers and web technologies that “just works” (we pride ourselves on making this engineering accomplishment feel simple) Made strides in improving the performance of downloading and uploading large amounts of resources quickly and efficiently Extended our product offering to support interactive demos for desktop and mobile apps Built out several custom no-code builders across our platform Created the beginning of our engagement platform to surface the value we provide to our customers \\ We’ve been fortunate to experience impressive growth this past year - in 2023 alone, we’ve exceeded growth targets every quarter, grew to hundreds customers and partnered with top names in the software industry including Ramp, Elastic, Digital Ocean and Dropbox. We are well funded by top-tier investors such as Y Combinator, have a lean team, extensive runway, and believe we are early on the product adoption curve. How we work Our engineering team takes pride in tackling ambitious projects while making the hard things seem easy. We come from different backgrounds, but are united by a shared love for building software that people love to use. Care deeply about user experience and deliver code that optimize for the short (prioritize getting job done) and long term (sustainable architecture). Work autonomously, from a product and technical perspective. Highly motivated to get the job done. Deliberate communication and action. We have daily standups and use slack, but prioritize respecting each others time so we can be productive. Seek to increase leverage, not team size.

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.
