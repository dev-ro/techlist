Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

        "description": "Job Description The trucking industry is the backbone of the global economy. More than 70% of what we consume in the U.S. is moved by trucks. Those trucks are powered by over 3.5 million drivers per year and create over $700B in annual revenue. Trucking is a massive industry but it is a traditional industry and like many traditional industries, it is ripe for innovation. CloudTrucks is building the operating system for trucking and is the first platform specifically designed to empower truck drivers. Our all-in-one, “business in a box” solution optimizes and automates operations and accelerates cash-flow for drivers, so they can focus on building their business. The Marketplace team at CloudTrucks tackles complex challenges with smart solutions in market prediction, pricing, and route optimization. We utilize data from myriad sources, including IoT, supply and demand-side financial & market transactions, economic time series, and user behavior streams. Given our unique position in the market at the intersection of shippers, carrier, and brokers our goal is to help drivers maximize profit and quality of life through the power of machine learning and AI. As an ML Engineer, you will own ML models and algorithms end-to-end for solving customer problems. You will also lead architecture decisions and guide technical strategy towards innovative and pragmatic solutions which bias us towards a superlative customer experience. How We Use ML at CloudTrucks Dispatch AI - Drivers are always focused on delivering their next load but the optimal dispatch schedule has to take into account not just the next stop but also the likely future stops the next stop will lead to. Dispatch AI is an automated system we’ve developed to leverage our internal market data and forecasting models to help drivers earn the most money on the optimal route. Prospector - In order to prosper in the competitive freight market our drivers need the best loads at the best prices. Prospector, our “bidbot”, identifies and bids on ideal loads available in load auctions. It uses various supply and demand models to generate bid prices ensuring we win the correct auctions to provide our drivers with more lucrative opportunities. Personalized Load Scoring - Every driver is unique and has their own preferences. We developed a personalized load scoring model based on driver booking histories to help us determine which drivers will prefer which loads. We use our personalized scoring in various features including sorting search results and identifying recommended loads for push notification. Responsibilities Design, implement, iterate, and manage ML models and algorithms end-to-end to solve customer problems Design, grow and operate our machine learning architecture prioritizing ease of use and automation Make judicious build vs buy decisions for our current modeling needs while preparing for 10x data volume as we rapidly scale Promote operational best practices for non-ML data products What we are looking for Strong technical background, including 4+ years of industry experience as an ML Engineer working on production systems Self-motivated and comfortable operating in a dynamic environment with a strong sense of ownership and an ability to drive a project from start to finish Takes a user-focused approach, shipping incrementally with rapid iterations Strong communication and collaboration skills.

We encourage each other to push the envelope, execute quickly, and be resilient to failure. We also work occasional late nights or weekends to deliver an above-and-beyond customer experience, while respecting and celebrating each other's personal background, values and commitments. In return, we are well compensated, take pride in seeing outsized impact to our product, and have memorable experiences learning and growing alongside a truly exceptional set of peers. About CloudTrucks CloudTrucks is a virtual trucking carrier in the multi-billion dollar trucking space. Core to this industry are over 3.5M truck drivers. They move more than 70% of all goods transported around the U.S., yet operate in a highly fragmented industry with huge opportunities for products, services and automation. We strive to deliver solutions that help truck drivers operate with much greater efficiency, increase their revenue, and offload business complexity. We are looking for uniquely exceptional people to join us on our journey as we massively scale into an industry-defining business.

        "description": "Who We Are Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too. At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 250,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more. Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond. We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors. What We're Looking For Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small. You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell. You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college. Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects. What You'll Do On the machine learning team, we primarily work on building and maintaining technology within Roboflow’s training, search and deployment services, but from time to time we're also helping deliver on enterprise contracts, and coding awesome open source projects and sample projects. In the beginning, you will be tackling projects in close collaboration with your fellow machine learning and product team members. As you progress in your knowledge of Roboflow’s mission and tools, you will have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for and drive your own projects. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit. We’re especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for scaling the engineering organization and the machine learning team. You certainly don't need to be an expert in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. The above tools span code in our machine learning stack to date - your opinions on new technologies that we adapt for new tasks will be highly valued. This role will inevitably involve wearing a lot of hats. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion are essential responsibilities. Our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time.

Who You'll Be Working With Our team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others. You will directly be working with our Machine Learning Lead and a team of Machine Learning Engineers. Where You'll Work Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best! When You'll Work Roboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you’ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed. What You'll Receive To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market. 💰 The target compensation for this role is $165,000 base salary. 📈 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits.

        "description": "Coactive makes it easy to search, filter, and analyze visual content. Increasingly image and video data captures the content we watch, the products we buy, and the work we do, and already represents 80% of internet traffic. But rather than being an asset, visual content is often a tax or even a liability because it is so hard to work with and understand. Coactive solves this by bringing structure to unstructured visual data. Rather than spending months (or years) building complex infrastructure, data teams can unlock the value of their visual data in minutes to power use cases such as content understanding and moderation, search, and analytics. Coactive was founded by experts who shaped the fields of high-performance deep learning and data-centric AI.

Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms. Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many). Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission. The Media Research team at HUMAN is dedicated to protecting the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime across the media and advertising ecostystems. Our team builds automated detection techniques that both mitigate against known botnet operations, but also are adaptable enough to find new fraud quickly and effectively across a variety of environments and threat types. We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team to manage the full-cycle of fraud fighting: from the early stages of gathering business requirements and exploratory research to the development and deployment in production of statistical detection techniques. This role is at the intersection of data, technology, and business as we aspire to deeply understand how actors are perpetrating schemes and develop a powerful product to delight our customers. What you'll do: Conduct research in our emerging product capabilities to identify fraud in new product lines and work together with product and engineering teams to launch features that give our customers additional insight into their traffic. Devise techniques that leverage the signals we collect from ad interactions to produce robust automated fraud detection techniques, using meticulous experimentation to find techniques that are difficult for bad actors to adapt around. Support experiments on prospects and new clients that demonstrate the value of our emerging products by highlighting anomalies consistent with fraud and conflicting with standard programmatic advertising behaviors. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientists’ work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, that ‘creating tau’ (disproportionate leverage) by accelerating our team’s ability to find fraud, automating cumbersome tasks, and creating novel methodologies. by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You have experience solving large-scale, data-intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different statistical modeling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc). You have a good sense of ownership which drives you to find ways to do things better, faster, and leaner; you hold yourself accountable for the quality and accuracy of your work You have experience working on cross-functional projects, with multiple stakeholders Previous background in AdTech strongly preferred, however we encourage you to apply even if your background is in a different industry The base pay range for this position is $130,000- $150,000 which can include additional on-target commission pay/bonus. The base pay offered may vary depending on location, job related knowledge, skills, and experience. Stock options and other incentive pay may be provided as part of the compensation package, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, depending on the position ultimately offered. HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together! With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia. We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, dedicated time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more. We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

        "description": "Why We Exist Every morning, 11,000 Americans wake up and begin their first day of retirement. While retirement should be an exciting, empowering, and fulfilling part of one's life, the reality today is that retirement brings along with it a fundamentally new set of challenges that make it an overwhelming time for many. At Chapter, we believe that the current infrastructure for retirement is broken, and we're on a mission to fix it. We've started by building industry leading technology to solve the first major obstacle in retirement: navigating Medicare (healthcare coverage for retirees over 65). Our products help seniors sign up, choose an insurance plan, and leverage their plan after they are enrolled. And, unlike most Medicare advisors who only search plans that pay them, Chapter searches every Medicare option nationwide. This allows us to find savings and benefits that others miss. But our ambition doesn't stop with Medicare — we seek to transform the way that Americans navigate and experience retirement. If this sounds exciting to you, we'd love to speak with you. About The Role: Chapter has built industry-leading, proprietary technology to fulfill a simple promise: Help retirees find the best health coverage to meet their needs while reducing what they pay for it. Data and analytics play a critical role in making good on that promise and is core to how Chapter hopes to differentiate itself in a market full of information opacity and technical challenges. As a data scientist at Chapter, you'll work hand in hand with a team of product managers, engineers and operators to help make sure we're building the product that delivers the most impact to our users.

The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design. At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it. We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments. This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.
