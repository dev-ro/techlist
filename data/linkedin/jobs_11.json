        "description": "As a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer at Flatfile, you will be at the forefront of automating data handling for enterprises. You will be one of the earliest members of our Applied AI team working to develop an AI-native data mapping, cleaning, and transformation experience for the world’s largest firms, automating the most stubborn data problems. Your work will contribute directly to creating industry-leading AI agents. We are not exclusively looking for people who have been an ML engineer in the past; if you are truly passionate about the problem space and spend your time consuming, learning and applying AI, we’d love to hear from you. This role reports to: Jon Bell, VP of Product This role may be listed at other companies as: Principal Software Engineer Applied AI Engineer AI/ML Systems Engineer In this role, you will: Develop a roadmap of meaningful applications of AI/ML for our customers––including optimizing our existing AI-powered features like Mapping and Transform Evaluate, build, fine-tune, and train AI/ML models for data import, mapping, cleaning, and transformation Research, design, train, and deploy AI agents that streamline data handling operations, reducing manual intervention Work closely with product engineers to develop new AI-powered features that solve important problems for our customers and feel like a magical experience Monitor and improve model performance over time through rigorous evaluation Optimize our Zero-trust AI approach for high performance and data privacy Drive projects from conception to production launch independently and as a leader of other product contributors Research novel AI techniques and strategies that create magical customer experiences If this sounds like a fun challenge, let’s define the Data Exchange category together! You'll likely thrive in this role if you: Have extensive prior experience building and maintaining production machine learning-powered product experience Hands-on experience fine-tuning and deploying open-source AI models Have prior experience building and iterating on enterprise-scale data systems Own problems end-to-end and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done Have the ability to move fast in an environment where things are sometimes loosely defined and may have competing priorities or deadlines Have a voracious and intrinsic desire to learn. And an equally strong talent for sharing that information clearly and concisely with others Consider applying if: Experience in an applicable ML area. E.g. NLP, Deep learning, Bayesian methods, Reinforcement learning, clustering Deep knowledge of a high-level programming language (for example, Python, Perl, etc.), but it doesn’t need to be a language that we use here! Great people are effective and learn what we use quickly (or introduce us to better ways of working) Advanced education in CS, ML, Math, Stats, or similar preferred Experience with model fine-tuning, distilling, and optimization Passion for prototyping AI-powered features Strong problem-solving skills and ability to prioritize effectively Experience collaborating directly with product teams and designers and a proven track record of delivering value to customers or users. Engineers at Flatfile are pragmatists who work closely with others on cross-disciplinary teams and have a strong sense of product strategy While many Engineering roles are similar, Flatfile’s Engineering roles are unique. With that in mind, you should pass on applying if: You don’t enjoy teaching others; this role will be one that is going to spearhead multiple new aspects of our business. We will look to you to share your knowledge and passion with AI with the rest of the company You don’t want to decide on the best-paved road to build for Flatfile and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give plenty of commentary and feedback on decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it You refrain from engaging in or find it challenging to handle debates about the future state of products; we need someone who can have an opinion yet remain open-minded You would prefer to avoid challenging the status quo or pushing the boundaries of technical possibilities, as this role demands continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies You’ve never worked in a fast-paced environment. We move quickly. And a lot of places say that, but trust us, we really do. If you’re one who gets frustrated when priorities change rapidly, we’re not the place for you In accordance with applicable law, the following represents Flatfile's reasonable estimate of the range of possible compensation for this role if hired in Colorado. Salary: $250,000 - $300,000 annually Equity: this role is eligible to participate in Flatfile's equity plan #BI-Remote Reasons you’ll love working here 🫂 Comprehensive health, vision, and dental insurance for you and your dependents 🏦 401k match. 100% matching for up to 3% and a 50% match for the next 2% 💸 Equity options for all full-time employees 🏠 100% remote work environment 🏖️ Flexible paid time off, with a recommended minimum of 3 weeks 🎨 $10,000 home office makeover with personal access to an interior designer 🛜 $150 per month toward cell phone and wifi 💻 The best tools to do your work, including a Mac laptop and top-of-the-line hardware. 🏥 24/7 access to a Health Advocate & free annual membership to One Medical 👶 12 weeks of paid family leave And much more!

Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades. Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically: We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them. Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

        "description": "Position Name: Machine Learning Engineer Location: Lincoln, MA or Remote Employment Type: Full-time Citizenship: US Citizens only Notes: Direct Hire. No third-party assistance is approved for this role. About The Job: At Jaxon, we are on a mission to make AI trustworthy. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in corporate settings is hindered by the “hallucination problem,” where AI models produce inaccurate or entirely fabricated responses. For regulated industries and high-risk applications, this issue is preventing LLM use altogether. This role is crucial in overcoming these challenges. As a Machine Learning Engineer at Jaxon, you will be responsible for developing and implementing machine learning models and algorithms to create more reliable AI systems. You will play a key role in delivering complex AI-driven solutions for customers, with a particular focus on defense applications as Jaxon is dual-use. We have a patent pending product, Domain-Specific AI Language (DSAIL), that forms the basis of most of our deployments. This role will be focused on increasing security and reliability for our customers through implementing DSAIL and building on its capabilities. A particular emphasis is placed on addressing the fundamental limitations of LLMs – they don’t understand context and logical reasoning. Once an LLM deviates from the right path, errors are more likely to occur. Training an AI away from this type of yes/no logic and into more human-like reasoning is at the core of this position. The Basics Of This Role Requires The Ability To Collaborate Across Teams: Work with cross-functional teams to integrate ML models into our existing systems and workflows, enhancing product capabilities. Optimize Data Processing and Model Performance: Conduct comprehensive data management including preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to improve accuracy and efficiency. Technical Proficiency: Demonstrate solid machine learning engineering experience, particularly with NLP applications and unstructured data in a cloud environment. Fluency in Python is essential. Understand Machine Learning Models: Needs to be intimately familiar with the process, but deploying ML models will not be a regular part of the job. Soft Skills Able to context switch as needed Able to compartmentalize different projects with different goals Able to communicate clearly and precisely - not just abstractions and \"lines-and-boxes\" Specific Technologies Docker, Docker Compose Python Python Data Science Stack - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Various deep learning packages Familiarity with calling web API's and making web API's Familiarity with modular architectures - IPC, publish-subscribe, etc… Nice-To-Haves Familiarity with predicate logic Familiarity with Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation for language grammars Lisp languages About Jaxon: Jaxon is a leading provider of machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions. We are committed to helping our customers solve complex problems with AI. Our products and services are used by businesses of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies. What Makes Jaxon Different? Human First: Our leaders get it — life happens. Whether it’s flexible working hours or understanding the need for a mental health day, we prioritize your well-being. Our CEO recognizes that happy people do the best work and he backs that up with an empathetically led culture – and I’m not just saying that because he’s going to read this post. Laid-Back Culture: We know that the best work comes from a place of comfort and authenticity. At Jaxon, you’re encouraged to be yourself, dress casually, and embrace your quirky side. It’s just one of the benefits of being an early-stage, high-growth startup. Tech Lover's Dream: From hackathons to tech talks with industry leaders, we fuel our passion for innovation with constant learning and development opportunities. Grunt Work to Grand Projects: Every task you tackle, big or small, matters. You think I’m writing job descriptions for fun? Sometimes things need to get done and it’s an all hands on deck situation to get them to the finish line. We're looking for team players who understand that achieving groundbreaking AI innovations sometimes involves rolling up your sleeves to tackle the essential, yet less glamorous tasks. Excited about the prospect of free snacks, massages, and a hot tub at the office? You might have to keep looking, as we're a fully remote team. However, if you ever feel the need to switch up your work environment, you’re always welcome at our office space in Lincoln, Massachusetts—includes a dartboard for slow afternoons. Added Perks Unlimited PTO: (seriously!) Comprehensive benefits: Health, dental, and vision insurance Competitive Salary: We provide competitive compensation packages commensurate with experience Stock Options: All compensation plans include stock options - join now and benefit from future acquisitions Holidays Off: ALL federal holidays are paid time off. Yes, even Indigenous People’s Day About You: You're the type of person who's naturally driven—not necessarily because you built a rocket in your backyard as a kid, but because you have a genuine curiosity about the world of technology. In your spare time, you might find yourself deep-diving into technology subreddits, following the latest industry trends, or exploring which companies are innovating and how. Your passion isn't just about staying informed; it's about thinking how you can take these emerging concepts and scale them up, make them faster, or more impactful. At Jaxon, we're looking for someone who sees a baseline and instinctively wants to build beyond it. If you’re ready to take what exists and make it extraordinary, you’ll fit right in. Job Description The engineering team at Jaxon warned me that all engineers hate when job descriptions specify bullet lists of X years of experience in technology Y such that time_exists(Y) < X. With that being said, there are no hard tech requirements, but experience with the python ML ecosystem and with LLMs is expected. Additionally: You should have a comfort level building and training models, not just calling cloud APIs, but you’re resourceful enough to recognize when you can use cloud APIs whenever you can get away with it. You aren’t afraid of digesting academic papers, but you understand that it’s code that matters. You’re going to need proven expertise in building ML applications. Proficient Python including demonstrable experience with libraries relevant to data manipulation. Ideally some experience with machine learning, in particular NLP applications. You are primarily in a development role, but are comfortable being customer-facing when needed. Active security clearance is a bonus. We are looking for somebody who thrives in an environment where day-to-day priorities and tasks may rapidly change. The role is not a fit if you value \"business as usual\". We value team members who are bold enough to pitch creative ideas, even if they're still rough around the edges or might not make the final cut. Education And Length Of Experience Preferably applicants will have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar, however at Jaxon, we value skills and dedication over degrees. We strongly encourage people without degrees to apply if you have at least 5 years of experience. Jaxon is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, or Veteran status",
