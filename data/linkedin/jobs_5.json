However, some roles may require more time in our offices. US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. Compensation and Benefits* Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates. Equity - For eligible roles , equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance. US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees: Optional equity donation matching. Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents. 401(k) plan with 4% matching. 22 weeks of paid parental leave. Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness. Fertility benefits via Carrot.

Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

        "description": "HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms. Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many). Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission. The Operational Efficiency team at HUMAN is dedicated to protecting the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. Our team of data scientists builds automation and capabilities as we evolve from reactive manual intervention to proactive automated solutions. We use the latest machine learning techniques to effectively disrupt threats and protect our customers, while also giving our analysts superhuman capabilities. We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team to stay two steps ahead of the most advanced botters on the internet. This role is at the intersection of data, technology, and business as we aspire to deeply understand how actors are perpetrating schemes and develop a powerful product to delight our customers. What you'll do: Build upon existing automation and DS platforms to automate reactive and proactive actions to detect and disrupt novel bot attacks. Devise techniques that leverage the signals we collect to produce robust automated fraud detection techniques, using meticulous experimentation to find techniques that are difficult for bad actors to adapt around. Support experiments that demonstrate the value of our emerging automation solutions by highlighting anomalies consistent with fraud. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientists’ work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, that ‘creating tau’ (disproportionate leverage) by accelerating our team’s ability to find fraud, automating cumbersome tasks, and creating novel methodologies. by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You have experience solving large-scale, data-intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different statistical modeling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Pydantic, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc). You are fluent in Object Oriented development and have strong debugging skills. You have a good sense of ownership which drives you to find ways to do things better, faster, and leaner; you hold yourself accountable for the quality and accuracy of your work You have experience working on cross-functional projects, with multiple stakeholders; and following SDLC best practices: project management, version control, unit testing, and CI/CD Level of Experience - Senior, 5-7 years of experience The base pay range for this position is $135,000- $170,000 which can include additional on-target commission pay/bonus. The base pay offered may vary depending on location, job related knowledge, skills, and experience. Stock options and other incentive pay may be provided as part of the compensation package, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, depending on the position ultimately offered. HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together! With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia. We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, dedicated time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more. We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life.

        "description": "Description Are you looking for a challenge? Imagine being part of a team that owns one of the largest supply chain simulation systems in the world to predict inventory flows for the millions of items available on Amazon.com worldwide. Inventory planning involves many algorithms to buy inventory in the right quantities, at the right frequencies, from the right vendors, and assigning to the best warehouse to fulfill customer demand to optimize long term free cash flow for Amazon. Our system lives at the heart of these algorithms, keeping up with the rapid pace of optimization improvements and simulating how they interact with each other. We simulate what these systems will do for months into the future, predicting inventory flows and key operational and financial metrics across the network. This experimentation platform is critical in understanding labor needs, managing our network capacity, and allowing continued optimizations to the many algorithms we simulate. Imagine enabling Amazon's supply chain systems to make data driven decisions based on simulations of trillions of inventory events per day. Every time an Amazon customer makes a purchase, a number of systems are involved: these systems help optimize inventory acquisition, enable a number of purchase options, ensure great pricing, store products so they are available for fast delivery, and minimize package frustration. The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) Group develops and manages these systems. We are central to Amazon customers' ability to find what they want and get it when they want it. Within SCOT, the IPC Simulation team is responsible for designing and executing the simulations and experiments that measure the impact of SCOT initiatives, as well as predicting inventory flows for labor planning. We are looking for data scientists to drive innovation in SCOT by pushing IPC Simulation systems further upstream in the innovation process, developing new techniques and analytics for both experimentation and prediction use cases, and applying existing models to our problem space and beyond.

        "description": "About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role In January 2024, Notion launched Notion Calendar, introducing the second app in the Notion suite. The launch was a massive success, and we’re now looking to grow the team. We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our small but mighty team to build the next-generation calendar. If you’re interested in building innovative, AI-powered products that create the magic of “1 + 1 = 3”, and showcase the best of using Calendar and Notion together, please let us know! What You'll Achieve We're looking for an experienced individual contributor who enjoys working alongside other experienced engineers and designers to iterate and build across the entire stack. Our team owns the Notion Calendar product end-to-end from perfecting pixels to scaling the database, so the ideal candidate is comfortable as a generalist full-stack engineer who brings expertise to one or more parts of the stack: frontend architecture, data model & API design, scaling infrastructure, etc. Build and co-own the core, user-facing product. You'll build the product and everything behind the scenes from the ground up, having a direct impact by shipping to users daily. You'll have autonomy and ownership because we are all individual contributors (including managers). You'll be involved in shaping the roadmap and owning the execution of it. Use modern web tech and influence the stack. We use React on the frontend, Node & Express on the backend, and TypeScript across the stack to build a best-in-class client and infrastructure that scales. You’ll get to make critical choices and lay the foundations. Create a robust and scalable backend. Architect data models, optimize database queries, and build performant REST APIs, 1st party Notion integrations, 3rd party integrations, product analytics, transactional emails, service observability, and more. Prototype new AI capabilities. You’ll work with Notion AI engineers to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into our product. Solve interesting technical problems. Bring your full creativity to solve challenging technical problems: from complex backend architecture with 1st and 3rd party integrations, real-time collaboration, syncing app state, to nifty client-side interactions. Skills You'll Need To Bring You're an individual contributor who has built such robust systems and products at scale before. We don't require formal qualifications but do value learning—especially from one another. We are looking for someone who feels a sense of duty to the users of their work. You have 5+ years of engineering experience and have built impressive products. Demonstrated ability to execute with excellence: You have thrived in fast-paced environments, tackling complex technical challenges with exceptional skill and precision. You’ve built robust software running at scale. Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. Curious and quick learning: We don't expect you to have experience in every technology we use, but to learn and be productive quickly. Owning several repos and jumping into all of them doesn't scare you. Design sensibility: While you'll co-craft the interface with top designers and frontend engineers, we expect you to have a knack for great UX, such that you feel if something is off and can flag it, or better yet, polish it. Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Nice To Haves You’re interested in productivity apps. You might use your calendar to time block, try out Chrome extensions, configure custom app launchers, or optimize your time in other ways. You've built or maintained apps using React, React Native, Electron or other frameworks. You have experience or interest in DevOps and the infrastructure side of building great software products. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in New York, the estimated base salary range for this role is $130,000 - $250,000 per year.",

This year alone, we've grown our platform to over 2 billion dollars (USD) worth of digital assets managed, scaled our app to hundreds of thousands of users, and captured meaningful recurring revenue along the way. We're a team of ~15 in NYC & Europe backed by Y-Combinator, Tiger Global, and the biggest names in the space (Tusk Ventures, Circle, Galaxy Digital, Solana Ventures, Polygon Ventures, GSR, Tower Research, and many more). Our engineering team comes from top finance and distributed systems companies like Gemini, Morgan Stanley, and Palantir. We've built exchange matching engines at scale, published AI papers at top journals, and exited startups to Fortune 500 companies prior to Magna. Our stack is primarily TypeScript (frontend + backend monorepo) and Rust (protocol + systems engineering). We care a lot about code quality and are active contributors to open source [1] [2] [3]. What will you be building? We're looking to expand our product suite (React + PostgreSQL) in line with the demand we're seeing from customers.

Shipping new features, architecting new high performance solutions (our platform is designed to help customers operate at scale), and interacting with our product/design team are all in scope for this role. You'll find this interesting if you like: Seeing your impact on a day-to-day basis. We currently average over $1M of transaction volume per day and have hundreds of thousands of users. Building in an engineering-first space. Web3 is predicated on decentralized and open access compute resources, which engineers are best positioned to take advantage of. Shipping fast. We sit at the center of the space in terms of our investors and customers, and are known as being a team that delivers across multiple ecosystems. Some example projects areas we've taken on are: Performance: Aggregating across multi-chain data sources to build a cache for historical blockchain transactions and price data. Features: Implementing transaction flows for customers managing financial operations at scale (e.g. managing 200K+ asset distributions through the self-serve product). Architecture: Migrating internal systems & libraries to an event-based architecture for readability + developer experience. User Experience: Designing consumer-oriented interactions for end-user portfolio management (e.g. fun animations on claiming). What We Offer Unlimited PTO.

From changing a single person’s daily commute to reducing humanity’s collective environmental footprint — we’ve got huge goals. As a Full Stack Software Engineer on one of our Remix product engineering teams, you’ll work in close collaboration with our designers, product managers, and customers to build products that are intensely focused on transit accessibility, equity, and sustainability. Our stack is mostly Typescript (with React, Redux, and Mapbox), Rails, Python, and Postgres/PostGIS. However, it's more important to us that you have experience with full-stack, user-centric development in general than with our specific technologies. What You’ll Do: Work on improving our planning products to help planners explore new concepts, make informed decisions with data, and rally people around their vision. Partner with engineers, product managers and designers to scope and ship new features. Work with customers to understand user needs, and then build to address those needs. Work with a variety of technologies across our stack for different projects, all to deliver great end-to-end user experience. Contribute to discussions about engineering best practices and architecture within your relevant area of expertise. Build and maintain our processes and tools, to keep our productivity and code quality high. Who You Are: You have a minimum of 4 years of professional software engineering experience, preferably in full-stack, user-centric development. Mission-driven: you’re passionate about companies with strong values and missions. User-centric: you find value in talking to customers and addressing core customer needs. Collaborative, humble, empathetic, and feedback-driven Experience in developing complex React applications is a plus, but not required Experience with geospatial or mapping technologies is a plus, but not required Compensation and Benefits: Final salary will be determined by the candidate’s experience, knowledge, and skills. Salary reflected does not include equity or variable pay, where applicable. Salary Range: $140,000-$180,000 We are proud to offer a generous and comprehensive benefits package, including free medical plans and 401K matching. We’re Via, and we build technology that changes the way the world moves. We pioneered the TransitTech category to ensure that the future of transportation is shared, dynamic public mobility — the kind that reduces carbon emissions across congested cities, minimizes reliance on private cars, and provides everyone with accessible, efficient, and affordable ways of getting around. We created the first end-to-end TransitTech solution for cities and transit agencies, offering world-class software, service design, and operational expertise to fundamentally improve the way the world moves. Via was founded with the guiding principle that we go further when we go together. We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace. If you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles. All backgrounds, identities, and voices are welcomed and celebrated at Via. Ready to join the ride?

As a Software Engineer you will: Own product development end-to-end — from brainstorming ideas and gathering requirements to launching new code to production Improve our existing products, which support both the entrepreneurs we invest in and our internal teams Work on a variety of apps in a variety of languages (Django, Python, React, Ruby on Rails, Vue, ) and help with dev ops on AWS/Heroku Build projects like these recent ones: First Round Yellowpages - Find the most relevant contacts that can help our internal team for various functions (talent, GTM, etc).

Our Values At First Round, we value resourcefulness, team-play, excellence and hustle. To give you a sense of what our team is all about, check out our values that guide our work: Try harder for founders. They’re our customers — LPs are our shareholders. Going above and beyond for our founders is what we do. We strive to be a founder's most valuable investor. That’s why we don't pull term sheets, and we're always in for their second round. We respond to their emails in hours, not days. We build candidate pipelines, unprompted. We arrange meal deliveries when they become a new parent. Simply put, we go above and beyond to earn that right to be their first call every time there’s a bump in the road. Give your unvarnished opinions and unwavering support. We strive to be kind, not nice. One of the most (counterintuitively) compassionate things you can do is to offer your unvarnished opinion — along with your unwavering support. That willingness to risk a fleeting moment of discomfort in exchange for someone else’s growth is long-term kindness. Treat the little things like big things. Everything can always be made better. We’re all about the carefully crafted, the nitty-gritty, and the bespoke. Whether it’s hand cutting each nameplate, or debating the optimal shape of the dinner table, no detail is too small to sweat. Make speed a habit. Whatever you’re building, remember that now is better than two weeks from now. We’re fans of starting small and iterating quickly. No matter what we’re launching, you’ll likely hear this question in a meeting: “How soon can we get something out there?” Invent and wander. Never stop experimenting. The best ideas are born out of experimentation. Our flagship programs have always come from our penchant for going out on a limb and approaching problems with a different perspective. Build wider doorways and longer tables. We're in the business of backing people and betting on their ideas — no matter where they come from. While talent is evenly distributed, opportunity is not. First Round is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workspace and we encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply! Compensation Range: $140K - $180K",

Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done. We are looking for outstanding product-focused software engineers who want to work on re-imagining a product that we developers use every day. As an Engineer at Warp, you'll have the chance to tackle difficult technical problems. One of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that, for historical reasons, the terminal/shell division makes it hard to innovate. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one! Also, as a foundational member of our early team, you'll be instrumental in shaping our company culture and long-term engineering practices. 🎥 Here's a quick 3-min video of Zach Lloyd, our founder and CEO, giving an overview of the product and the company: https://www.loom.com/share/b2824d2c8cd649faa466d6ca2a770939 As a Software Engineer, you will… Participate in all aspects of software development activities, including design, coding, code review, unit/integration testing, bug fixing, and code/API documentation.

About Warp We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world. We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide. We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. In August 2023, we announced a $50M Series B funding round ($73M total raised), led by Sequoia Capital. Our other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group. We are also backed by a network of passionate angels, including Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma), Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce), and Sam Altman (Co-Founder & CEO, OpenAI). The Product Here's our latest demo showing some of our current features… This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more. The Opportunity The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships. To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects. At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers. A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called \"Why You Should Join.\" It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis.
