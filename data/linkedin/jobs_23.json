        "description": "\"Men and Women Wanted: For hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.\" - Edward Shackleton, explorer of the Antarctic Why be with company ? We all know what a great neighborhood feels like. The sad reality is that every day, our neighborhoods are losing their character, authenticity, and sense of community. From Main Streets to Manhattan, our beloved local businesses are being pushed out at unprecedented rates, replaced with corporate brands or empty storefronts. America is losing its small business backbone — its diversity, energy, and competitive edge. All while there is a generational opportunity in commercial real estate directly ahead of us. We've been quietly and deliberately building withco to empower millions of small businesses to seize their opportunity to become their own landlords. And if we're successful, we'll have created not only the most financially impactful company of its time, but also neighborhoods that we're proud to live in. Join our mission to make it exciting to be a small business owner in America. We've raised $30M+ from the world's best investors, including Founders Fund, Canaan, NFX, BoxGroup, and angels like Ken Chenault, Danny Meyer, Venus Williams, Kevin Durant, and more. How you'll help us succeed: As a member of a small and highly collaborative engineering team, you'll problem-solve technical solutions across the business. From building engaging products for our customers to developing efficient tools for our internal team, you'll be involved with architecting, coding, and deploying products to production. Reporting to our Head of Engineering, you'll be mission-critical to withco, building the systems that help us scale our core product, and making the prospect of ownership a reality for small business owners in America. As we grow, you'll build the tooling that helps our small business partners compete with the likes of Whole Foods and Starbucks, and become even more connected with the neighborhood they serve. What you'll do: Collaborate and pair with other engineers and product managers to identify and problems solve challenges across the business Build high-quality products and tools in an agile fashion that support both our small business partners and our internal team Take ownership of high impact initiatives that improve our data quality, provide reliable access to that data, and help us make better decisions Shape our technical strategy, advocate for best practices, and spike out new technologies What makes you a great fit: You have at least 8+ years of experience building high-quality web applications across the entire front end-to-back end stack You enjoy working in cross-functional teams, collaborating closely with product, design, and other areas of the business You value automated testing and implementing good testing practices (unit tests, test-driven development) You are comfortable with agile processes (e.g. XP, Scrum, Kanban) and engineering practices (e.g. CI/CD, test-driven development, pair programming) You approach problems in a thoughtful way — you value simplicity, justify technical decisions and articulate tradeoffs Our Culture While small business is for everyone, withco's culture is not for everyone. In fact, it's for a very, very, very select group - an unusual, stunning minority who are audacious enough to achieve the impossible. What makes our culture so special is how much we: Expect team members to raise the bar Push on pace, while running the distance Obsess over our craft Challenge norms with courage and curiosity Share information broadly, deliberately, and directly Our values are inspired by our customers. If these values describe you, and the people you want to work with, you're likely to thrive here. Relentlessness Obsession Curiosity Macro-Optimism Clarity Accountability Selflessness Our Benefits We're building withco to create generational wealth not only for our small business customers, but also our team members. We endeavor to make it the most meaningful career experience of your life with brilliant colleagues. In addition, we offer: Top decile all-in compensation for our stage Eligibility for carried interest in our real estate vehicles 100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance A beautiful office in SoHo Unlimited PTO and WFH Paid parental leave 401(k), FSA/HSA, and commuter benefits Weekly team lunch and regular team events, always from/at a small business We're proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We care about building a uniquely diverse, energetic, inclusive, and service-oriented team — one that understands, cares about, and represents the different small business communities we aim to serve.",

As healthcare costs have increased, the patient’s home has become incredibly important as a site of care. Yet, patients recovering at home are highly underserved. Patients can only get better at home if they receive the high-quality care that they need reliably. The existing in-home care process involves patchwork of different vendors, all connected through faxes by nurses. We’re building modern, robust software that solves this challenge. We currently work with patients and hospitals across the United States. We’re backed by some of the best investors in technology and healthcare and have ambitious expansion plans. It’s a particularly exciting time to join the company as we’re aggressively expanding the team. Note: This is a remote-friendly role, but we do have a preference for candidates who can work out of our NYC (Chelsea) office. Why This Role: Verse is one of the fastest growing companies in digital health. There isn’t that much out there about us online, but we’re solving a pretty critical set of problems within healthcare and we’ve found clear product-market fit.

Every engineer works closely with customers & internal teams to define exactly what needs to be built. We’ve found that having our engineering team closely understand our users’ and internal needs has been critical to our success. This means that you quickly get exposure to the full product development process at Verse. We’ve maintained a high bar for talent. We strive to hire folks that have the skills to take ownership of features & products end to end. Role Responsibilities: Build software for hospitals and patients that will make their lives easier. Find creative solutions to complex technical and product problems. Build prototypes fast, but with a path in mind to turn them into robust systems over time. Operate with a lot of independence and responsibility in solving complex issues. Work with relevant stakeholders outside of engineering to figure out the right solutions to issues. Requirements: 4+ years of experience working as a full stack software engineer. Technical undergraduate degree or equivalent work experience. Experience with backend development with Javascript, Python, etc. Exposure to frontend development with React, Vue, Angular, etc. Experience with SQL databases (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) and deep familiarity with SQL. Great communication, written and verbal. Technologies: Languages: Python and Typescript Infrastructure: Postgres, Airflow, AWS, Google Cloud Platform Frameworks: Flask, React, Apollo GraphQL Engineering Values: Pragmatism over elegance. Simplicity of implementation. Speed of execution. Strong fundamentals in one's domain. Benefits: Salary range of $150,000 - $200,000. This pay range is provided for candidates based in New York City. Exact compensation may vary based on skills, experience, and location. Opportunities for rapid career advancement in a growing company. 100% premium coverage for health and dental insurance. 401(k) with no matching at this time.",

We’re focused on internet construction first (laying fiber, building cell towers). We help telcos save money and a lot of time by automating the manual work that gets in the way of building. Clad’s growing quickly with real sparks of product-market fit. And, we’ve raised $2.7M from an incredible set of investors including Y Combinator, Better Tomorrow Ventures, and a bunch of top-notch industry angels. Telecom construction is a massive, $86B/yr market that still runs on antiquated spreadsheets and emails. But we’re not stopping here. Over time, we’ll expand to power all infrastructure so the backbone of our world gets built faster. What's the role? A founding, full stack engineer. You'll be responsible for building out every aspect of Clad's product. Ideally, you shape not just the code, but also the direction of the business - informing how we work, the products we build, and the team that we'll assemble to achieve our vision. The details. You can code. And I mean code. You are a full-stack, product-oriented engineer with a focus on craft, continuous learning, and a whole lot of energy.

We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning. Flex Time Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as: Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental 100% Medical Reimbursement Time Off with Pay Profit Sharing Plan 401k Educational Benefits Additional Income IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary. Profit Sharing Plan (PSP) The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP. Stock Options Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company. Lifelong Learning Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through the use of company provided online learning opportunities, periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.

        "created_on": 1720637878.2368033,
        "description": "A little about us: The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed. Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you. A day in the life: Despite the title of this role being “Data Engineer” (which sounds very specific), it is actually a great opportunity to demonstrate the diversity of your skills across the data science spectrum. From procurement, consolidation, and cleansing to modeling and presentation, you will influence and add value in several areas across the data science life cycle in order to answer mission and business questions. Subject areas include but are not limited to the following: Employ a variety of languages and tools (e.g., scripting languages) to integrate systems. Conduct research and leverage large volumes of data from multiple sources to answer mission and business questions. Employ sophisticated analytics, programs, machine learning, and statistical methods to prepare data for use in analytical processes and prescriptive modeling. Explore and examine data for hidden patterns. Automate work through the use of predictive and prescriptive analytics. Develop processes to extract/transform/load (ETL) data between different systems. What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. All of our data scientists need the following skills: Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list. A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects. For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects. For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. For this particular role, you will also need: Experience in identifying, developing, and deploying new approaches to automate data collection, consolidation, and analysis Proven ability to develop and deploy software and scripts needed to collect business-relevant metrics based on enterprise data These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory: Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding) Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React Familiarity with Agile processes and structures, and able to work on a software development team Why Red Alpha? Every day, our elite customers are pushing through \"the grind\" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we bring digital transformation to the fight. Some of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned: Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life: Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid floating holidays. You can stay at your best: As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.
